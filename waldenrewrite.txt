ON THE DUTY OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE

WALDEN

Economy

When I wrote these pages, I lived alone in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house I built on the shore of Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. I sustained myself through manual labor and lived there for two years and two months. Now, I am back in civilized life.

I wouldn’t share so much about myself if my neighbors hadn’t shown great interest, asking questions about my eating habits, loneliness, fears, charitable contributions, and how many poor children I supported. I hope those uninterested will forgive my explanations. Unlike most books that omit first-person narration, I will retain it—there’s no one I know better than myself to discuss. My limited experiences confine me to this subject. I expect every writer to provide a sincere account of their life, just as they would to family from afar. These pages might particularly benefit poor students, while others may find relevant insights. I hope no one misuses these reflections.

I want to address readers in New England about their lives, especially their outward conditions and whether they can be improved. In Concord, I’ve seen people in various occupations enduring remarkable hardships. The extreme penances of Brahmins are not more astonishing than the daily struggles I witness. The twelve labors of Hercules pale compared to what my neighbors endure, with no end in sight or victory gained.

Young men inherit farms, houses, and tools, a burden they can’t easily escape. It might have been better if they were born in the wild, guided by clearer vision towards their true calling. Why should they toil relentlessly on inherited land? Many push a heavy load through life, their spirits nearly crushed under barns, stables, and acres of land. Those without such burdens struggle enough to manage their own flesh.

Men labor under a misconception. The best part of them is soon buried, used as compost. They are driven by a supposed necessity to amass wealth that moth and rust destroy. It’s a fool’s life they’ll recognize too late. According to the myth, Deucalion and Pyrrha created men from stones, proving our hard-hearted nature. This blind obedience to a faulty oracle results in hardship and care, without understanding where it leads.

Most men, even in this relatively free country, are so burdened by unnecessary cares and crude labors that they miss life's finer joys. Their fingers are too rough from excessive work to handle these delicacies. The laboring man lacks the time for true integrity and meaningful relationships, as his work is undervalued. He becomes just a machine, unable to embrace the ignorance necessary for growth because he is too busy using his knowledge. To fairly judge him, we should sometimes provide for his basic needs and give him rest. The finest human qualities require delicate handling, yet we do not treat ourselves or each other tenderly.

Many of you struggle financially, often living on the edge, trying to pay for basic necessities and spending borrowed time. I see the mean lives many lead, always trying to get into business and out of debt, promising to pay tomorrow but dying insolvent today. You compromise your integrity to gain favor, often engaging in dishonest behavior to make a living while trying to save for the future. Feeling enslaved by public opinion is tough, but being a slave to your own opinion is even worse. Self-emancipation of the mind is a concept often overlooked. 

The mass of men live in quiet desperation. What is called resignation is actually confirmed desperation. Even under the guise of games and amusements, there is unconscious despair. True playfulness comes after work, but wisdom avoids desperate acts.

People often believe their way of living is the only choice, yet healthy, alert minds remember that change is possible. No old way of thinking should be accepted without proof. What is accepted as truth today might be falsehood tomorrow. The young have their own experiences to gain; the old cannot fully instruct them. Life remains largely untried, and each person must discover things for themselves. 

A farmer told me one couldn't survive solely on vegetables, yet his oxen, fed on vegetables, easily pull his plow. Some things deemed necessary in one context are luxuries or unknown in others. Human potential is vast and often underestimated. 

We could test life by simple observations; the same sun that ripens beans also illuminates entire systems of worlds. Realizing this could prevent many misunderstandings. Different beings across the universe might view the same star, revealing life's varied perspectives. Experiencing life through another's eyes, even for an instant, would be the most enlightening reading.

Much of what society calls good, I believe to be bad. If I regret anything, it's my moments of good behavior that felt contrary to my true nature. Each generation abandons the endeavors of the previous one, like stranded ships.

We can trust more in the natural order and worry less about ourselves. Nature caters to both our strengths and weaknesses. The constant anxiety some people feel is almost incurable. We exaggerate the importance of our work, yet so much remains undone or would if we fell ill. Despite our vigilant efforts to avoid living by faith, uncertainties persist. Living sincerely means acknowledging the possibility of change, as there are countless ways of living. Change, though miraculous, happens every moment. Confucius said true knowledge is knowing what we know and admitting what we don't. When one person transforms imagination into understanding, it lays the groundwork for everyone's future understanding.

Consider the trouble and anxiety we often face and how much of it is necessary. Living a simpler life, even amidst civilization, helps us learn what the basic necessities truly are and how they have traditionally been obtained. Historical records reveal the essential goods people bought, emphasizing that modern advancements haven't altered fundamental human needs, much like our skeletons are similar to those of our ancestors.

Necessities of life include those things obtained through effort that have always been essential: Food being primary. For animals, like the bison, food and shelter are sufficient. Humans in colder climates need more: Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel. Only once these are secured can people address life's deeper problems. In addition to houses, humans invented clothes and cooked food, with fire transforming from a luxury to a necessity. Observing how even domesticated animals seek warmth highlights this progression. Proper shelter and clothing conserve our internal heat, while excess external heat might be considered the start of cooking ourselves. Darwin noted that natives in Tierra del Fuego sweated in conditions where well-dressed Europeans were barely warm, emphasizing our varied responses to temperature.

The central goal is to maintain our body's vital heat. Efforts extend to our beds, which act as night shelters. Coldness, both physical and social, contributes significantly to our miseries. Summer provides a reprieve, making life easier and reducing the need for fuel and extensive clothing. Modern necessities now include tools and books for the studious, all attainable at minimal cost. Yet, some people travel to distant lands to trade, seeking wealth just to live warmly.

Luxuries and many comforts hinder human elevation. Historically, the wisest lived simply. Ancient philosophers were poor in material wealth but rich in wisdom, as were modern reformers. Observing life from voluntary poverty provides true insight. Luxurious living often leads to degeneration, while philosophers must find better ways to maintain their vital heat than the average person.

Once basic needs are met, pursuing excess is unnecessary. Instead, one should embrace life and its higher pursuits. The soil of our existence allows us to grow upwards, like noble plants valued for their fruits. This doesn't mean prescribing a minimalist lifestyle to all. Those who thrive in the current state or feel well-employed should continue. However, the majority who are discontent should seek improvement. Lastly, there are those who, though seemingly wealthy, are the most impoverished due to their inability to use or rid themselves of their accumulated riches, forging their own chains of gold and silver.

Reflecting on how I wished to spend my life might surprise those familiar with my actual history and certainly astonish those who are not. Here are some of the ventures I have cherished.

No matter the weather or time, I have always aimed to seize the moment, standing at the confluence of past and future—the present. You might find some of this vague because my trade, unlike most, naturally harbors secrets. However, I'd freely share everything about it and never label my gate "No Admittance."

Long ago, I lost a hound, a horse, and a dove, and I'm still tracking them. I’ve spoken to many travelers about them, describing their traces and calls. A few had heard the hound, the horse’s tread, or seen the dove vanish behind a cloud, sharing my eagerness to find them.

I sought to anticipate not just dawn, but Nature herself. Many mornings, even before neighbors stirred, I was about my business. My townsmen often saw me returning, though I never truly helped the sun rise; being present was what mattered.

Many autumn and winter days, I spent outside town, listening to the wind and running against it. I nearly exhausted my resources and breath doing this. If it had political significance, you’d find it in the Gazette. Other times, I watched from cliffs or tree observatories, waiting to catch something from the sky, though I rarely did.

For years, I was a reporter for a small journal whose editor rarely published my work. As is common, I labored without reward; yet, my efforts were their own reward.

I served as a self-appointed inspector of snow and rainstorms, ensuring forest paths and routes were open year-round. I also tended to the wild stock, nooks, and corners of the farms, watering various plants that might have otherwise withered.

Despite faithfully minding my business, it became clear my townsmen wouldn’t recognize me as an official. My honest accounts were neither audited nor paid, but I didn’t dwell on it.

Once, an Indian selling baskets was told by a lawyer they weren’t needed. The Indian, seeing neighbors prosper from their trades, had assumed his work would be valued too. Like him, I had woven my baskets without ensuring their worth to others. Instead of figuring how to sell them, I focused on avoiding the need to.

Recognizing I wasn't suited for conventional roles, I turned to the woods, deciding to use my modest resources to conduct private business at Walden Pond. This wasn't about living cheaply or expensively but to carry out my tasks with minimal obstacles.

Valuing business habits is vital for everyone. If your trade is with the Celestial Empire, a small coastal office will suffice. Export local products like ice and timber, and manage all aspects personally. Stay informed of market conditions and global events, using advances in navigation and science. Regularly assess your progress and adapt, keeping pace with competitors.

Walden Pond, with its unique advantages, seemed an ideal business location—not just for the railroad and ice trade. It offers a solid foundation, though like any venture, requires effort to build upon.

Starting a business without traditional capital raises questions about securing indispensable resources. On clothing, we often prioritize novelty and social opinions over utility. For those with practical work, clothing's main purpose is to retain body heat and cover nakedness. Kings and queens, who wear outfits only once, miss the comfort of well-fitted garments that become extensions of their wearers over time. A patch on clothes doesn't lower my estimation of anyone, yet there's more concern for fashionable or clean clothes than a sound conscience. Unmended clothes might indicate improvidence, not a lack of respectability.

Testing acquaintances with the challenge of wearing patches reveals a widespread fear that it might ruin their prospects more than a physical injury would. Society respects appearances over genuine worth. Even a scarecrow can command more recognition based on clothes. I recall recognizing a farmer dressed no better than his scarecrow, and a dog that barked at clothed strangers but not at a naked thief, highlighting how clothes shape perceptions of rank.

Madam Pfeiffer, in her travels, felt the need to dress formally when nearing home, reflecting the societal judgment based on attire. Even in democratic areas, accidental wealth and its display earn respect. However, this respect is hollow, warranting missionary efforts to address such superficial values. Clothing has introduced endless sewing, especially in women's attire, signifying an unending task.

A person with a purpose doesn't need new clothes; old garments suffice. Heroes often make do with old shoes or even bare feet. New clothes are a necessity only for social events or legislative halls. In daily life, if clothes are suitable for worship, they are sufficient. Old clothes, when worn out, often become charitable donations. Enterprises should aim for a renewed person, not new clothes. True transformation should make old garments symbolize new achievements, like moulting seasons signify changes in nature.

We accumulate clothes as a plant gains layers, with our outer clothes being a removable false skin. Thicker, everyday garments are more integral, akin to a tree's cortex, while shirts are like the true bark. Simplistic living allows for self-reliance and preparedness, even during crises. Affordable, durable clothing negates the need for fashion-driven purchases.

When requesting specific garment styles, tailors often defer to current trends, highlighting fashion's impersonal authority. Fashion dictates rather than personal preference. Despite challenges, simple and honest work remains possible, although societal norms require transformation first.

Overall, fashion hasn't risen to an art form; people wear what they find, often laughing at old fashions while adhering to new ones. Seriousness in life and character sanctifies any costume. Preferences for new patterns drive the market whimsically. Factory systems prioritize corporate profits over honest clothing needs, resembling exploitative conditions seen in other industrialized nations.

Ultimately, aiming high, even if immediate failure follows, is better for long-term success in clothing and other life pursuits.

Shelter is increasingly essential, though some have survived without it in colder regions. Samuel Laing observed that Laplanders, in their skin attire and bags, could sleep on snow in extreme cold, yet they weren't hardier than others. Despite the initial discomfort, people soon realized the benefits of a house, providing comfort and protection, particularly in harsh weather conditions. Even in milder climates, early humans built shelters for warmth and comfort, evolving from simple coverings to more robust structures.

Primitive humans likely began by seeking refuge in natural shelters like caves. This instinct persists in children, who enjoy playing outdoors and creating makeshift homes. From caves, humanity advanced to palm leaf, bark, bough, linen, grass, straw, board, shingle, stone, and tile roofs. Today, our lives are predominantly domestic, detached from the experience of living in the open air. Experiencing life without barriers between us and the natural world could offer significant benefits.

Should one decide to build a house, practical ingenuity is crucial to avoid ending up in an impractical or unsuitable dwelling. Minimal shelter suffices for basic needs; even in snowy conditions, simple tents can provide adequate protection. Reflecting on simpler solutions, a large box can serve as a basic shelter, offering freedom from the obligations of rent and landlords.

Historically, durable houses were made from readily available materials. As Gookin described in 1674, Native American homes were tightly constructed from tree bark or bulrush mats, providing warmth and comfort. These homes, some quite large, were efficiently built or dismantled and relocated. This adaptability ensured each family had a secure and cozy place to live.

In the savage state, every family owns a basic shelter that meets their simple needs. By contrast, in modern society, fewer than half of families own a home. In cities, the number is even smaller, with most people paying rent—a cost that could otherwise buy an entire village of Indian wigwams. This rent keeps them poor throughout their lives. Renting may provide better living conditions—spacious rooms, modern amenities—but the civilized man remains poor compared to the savage who owns his shelter, which costs very little.

Civilization is considered an advancement, yet it hasn’t made housing more affordable. The cost of a house, around $800 in this neighborhood, requires 10-15 years of a laborer's life without family responsibilities, given an average wage of $1 a day. This means more than half a person's life is spent earning their home. Renting, while avoiding this long-term saving, still represents a poor economic choice.

Ownership of property, while seen as a fund for the future, mainly covers funeral expenses. This highlights the difference between civilized life, focused on the collective, and savage life, focused on the individual. Civilized life absorbs the individual for the race's benefit, but at a steep cost, suggesting a need to find a balance where benefits are secured without drawbacks.

Farmers in Concord, despite being relatively well-off, labor for decades to own their farms, often burdened with debt. Only a few truly own their homes outright. Surprisingly, most mortgaged properties are fully paid off by very few. Similarly, most merchants fail financially, often due to moral rather than fiscal reasons. This points to a deeper societal issue where even successful individuals may be morally bankrupt.

Modern civilization often relies on bankruptcy and financial manipulation, whereas the savage faces direct survival challenges. The farming community continues its traditions, hosting events like the Middlesex Cattle Show, yet remains entangled in complex economic struggles.

Farmers complicate their livelihoods by turning simple needs into elaborate trades, like speculating in cattle for minor gains. This complexity traps them in poverty, just as society at large misses out on simple comforts in pursuit of luxuries, echoing the sentiment that earthly ambitions often strip away true contentment.

When the farmer builds his house, he might end up poorer as the house owns him, rather than the other way around. Momus criticized Minerva's house because it wasn’t movable, suggesting that a bad neighborhood could be avoided; our homes today still imprison us. Some families can't sell their houses on the outskirts to move into the village, and only death will free them.

Even as most people manage to own or rent modern houses, civilization has improved homes but not the inhabitants. We have palaces, but not necessarily noblemen or kings. If a civilized man’s pursuits are as unworthy as a savage’s, why should he have a better dwelling?

For the poor minority, as some rise above the savage's conditions, others fall below. Luxury for one class is balanced by poverty for another. While palaces stand, almshouses exist too. The builders of grand structures often live worse than savages. Civilization's outward signs don’t guarantee a better condition for many, as seen in the shanties by railroads where people live in squalor. This is also true for laborers in England and Ireland and even for operatives in the Southern States who produce exports but live poorly. This applies not just to the extremely poor but also to those in so-called moderate circumstances.

Most people never consider what a house truly is and stay needlessly poor trying to match their neighbors. They think they must have more, rather than being content with less. Society pressures young men to collect superfluous possessions. Why shouldn’t our furniture be as simple as that of Arabs or Indians? The benefactors of humanity, revered for their divine gifts, did not have elaborate possessions. Why not allow our furniture to be more complex only if we are morally and intellectually superior to simpler civilizations?

Currently, our homes are cluttered, and much of it should be cleaned out. Real work should focus on more meaningful pursuits. I discarded three pieces of limestone from my desk because they needed daily dusting, while my mind’s furniture remained neglected. I prefer the open air, where no dust gathers on the grass, unlike where humans tread.

The luxurious and dissipated set trends that others follow. The traveler who stays at the best inns quickly finds this out, as innkeepers assume extravagance and would soon strip him of comfort if he allowed. On trains, we prioritize luxury over safety and convenience, risking becoming nothing more than mobile drawing rooms with their exotic decor. I'd rather sit alone on a pumpkin than share a velvet cushion or ride an ox cart in the open air than a plush train car filled with stale air.

Primitive life had the advantage of making man a sojourner in nature. Once refreshed, he continued his journey, living temporarily without permanent homes. Now, we have become slaves to our possessions. The independent gatherer has become a farmer, and the one seeking shelter under a tree has become a householder. We no longer camp for the night but have settled indefinitely, forgetting dreams of heaven. Christianity has become an improved farming method, focusing on establishing family homes and tombs. Art once aimed to elevate us beyond this state, but now it serves to embellish our settled lives without truly liberating us. There's no space for fine art in our lives, houses, or streets—we lack even a nail for a picture or a shelf for a hero's bust. Our elaborate lives make us forget what’s genuine, leading us to superficial enjoyments. The most significant leap known is that of certain wandering Arabs, clearing twenty-five feet on level ground unaided. 

When I see grandiose propriety, I question, “Who supports you? Are you among the successful three or the failing ninety-seven?” Only then might I appreciate your adornments. Beauty should be built on solid foundations, which we currently lack. True taste for beauty is best cultivated outdoors, free from constraints.

Old Johnson, chronicling the early settlers, noted they started with simple shelters, only later building houses after ensuring basic sustenance. Early writings describe initial dwellings as simple pits lined with wood and bark, accommodating whole families until they could build proper houses. These settlers demonstrated pragmatic wisdom by prioritizing immediate needs.

Today, our spiritual needs are thinner than our ancestors' physical ones, echoing their resourcefulness but in a different context. Our houses should first be filled with intrinsic beauty, not outer ornamentation, yet I know from experience how they truly are.

Although we aren't so degenerate as to reject primitive living completely, it's wiser to use modern conveniences. Materials like boards, bricks, and shingles are more accessible and practical than primitive resources. With more ingenuity, we could use these materials to enhance our civilization and well-being. A civilized man is ultimately a smarter savage. Now, let me hasten to my own experiment.

Near the end of March 1845, I borrowed an axe and went to the woods by Walden Pond to cut timber for my house. Borrowing seemed necessary, but it also connected others to my project. The axe's owner called it his most prized possession, yet I returned it sharper than before. The hillside where I worked, with views of the pond and a small clearing where new trees were growing, was pleasant. The pond ice had not fully melted, and occasional snow flurries gave way to sunny days with birds returning.

One day, after repairing my axe with a wedge from a green hickory and soaking it to swell the wood, I saw a striped snake underwater, likely still in a torpid state. This made me think men remain in a similar primitive condition, needing a spring awakening to rise to higher lives. By April 1st, rain had melted the ice, and I heard a lost goose in the fog.

For days, I cut and shaped timber, studs, and rafters with my narrow axe, often singing to myself:

Men say they know many things;
But lo! they have taken wings,—
The arts and sciences,
And a thousand appliances;
The wind that blows
Is all that anybody knows.

I hewed the main timbers six inches square, leaving some bark for strength. Each piece was carefully mortised or tenoned using borrowed tools. My workdays were short; I took lunch in the woods, reading the newspaper my bread and butter were wrapped in, which added a pine fragrance from the pitch on my hands. Eventually, I felt more like a friend to the trees I felled. Occasionally, passersby stopped to chat, drawn by the sound of my axe.

By mid-April, I leisurely completed framing my house. I had bought James Collins’ shanty for boards; his hut was an unusually fine one. When I visited, he was absent, so I inspected it from the outside. It was small, with a peaked roof, surrounded by raised dirt like a compost heap. The roof, though warped by the sun, was the sturdiest part. There was no door-sill, merely a path for hens under the door board. Mrs. Collins invited me inside, where it was dark and damp, with a dirt floor and a few scattered boards. She showed me the interior with a lamp, cautioning me about a two-foot-deep dust hole she called a cellar. The shanty had “good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a good window,” albeit broken by their cat. It contained a stove, a bed, a place to sit, a silk parasol, a gilt-framed mirror, and a coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling. We quickly finalized the deal for $4.25. Collins would vacate by 5 a.m., and I would take possession at 6 to avoid dubious claims.

Early the next morning, I passed Collins and his family on the road, their belongings in one bundle, except the cat, which fled to the woods. I dismantled the shanty and moved it to the pond in small cartloads, laying the boards on grass to bleach and straighten. A thrush sang as I worked. A neighbor, Seeley, surreptitiously pocketed nails during the move, claiming a dearth of work.

I dug my cellar on a south-sloping hill where a woodchuck had burrowed, through sumach and blackberry roots, to fine sand that wouldn't freeze potatoes. It took two hours, and I enjoyed the work, noting that even under grand city houses, cellars are dug to store roots.

In early May, friends helped raise my house frame to foster neighborliness. By July 4th, the house was boarded and roofed, making it rainproof. I began living there, having laid a chimney foundation before boarding the house, hauling stones up the hill. I later built the chimney and cooked outside until fall, finding it more agreeable. When it stormed, I sheltered my fire with boards and enjoyed the process. Busy with construction, I read little, finding scraps of paper as entertaining as the Iliad.

It would be worthwhile to build more deliberately, considering the foundational needs of doors, windows, cellars, and attics beyond mere temporal necessities. Just as a bird naturally builds its own nest, there is a natural fit in a man building his own house. If people constructed their homes and provided food simply and honestly, the poetic faculty might flourish universally, much like birds singing while nesting. Unfortunately, we act more like cowbirds and cuckoos, relying on others' creations and contributing nothing of our own. Should we forever leave the joy of building to carpenters? What does architecture mean to most people? I've never seen anyone building their house in all my walks. We are part of a community where roles are fragmented; it’s not just the tailor who is a fraction of a man, but also the preacher, merchant, and farmer. Where will this division of labor end, and what is its ultimate purpose? While someone else might think for me, it shouldn't exclude my own thinking.

Architects exist in this country, and I've heard of at least one who believes architectural ornaments should embody truth and necessity, thereby achieving beauty. This idea, while better than mere dilettantism, is still flawed. He was a sentimental reformer who started with cornices instead of foundations, focusing on ornaments having inner truth rather than ensuring the entire structure reflected genuine craftsmanship.

Reasonable people know that ornaments are not just superficial; their beauty stems organically from within, much like a tortoise’s shell or a shellfish’s mother-of-pearl. Just as a person’s character isn't defined by outward symbols, architectural beauty should evolve from the necessities and character of the builder. Amid genuine life, beauty arises unconsciously, without preoccupation with superficial appearances.

The most charming homes are the modest log huts and cottages of the poor, their appeal rooted in the lives of their inhabitants, not in decorative surfaces. Similarly, suburban homes will be more appealing when their design reflects the simplicity and authenticity of their occupants’ lives. Many architectural ornaments are hollow and would be stripped away by a strong wind, revealing their lack of substance.

Making much ado about ornamental style in architecture is akin to obsessing over literary flourishes. True importance lies not in the superficial embellishments but in the structure’s genuine integrity. For a home, it’s not about daubing it with colors but ensuring it reflects the spirit of its inhabitants.

Before winter, I built a chimney and shingled my house with sappy shingles, straightening their edges with a plane. My house is now tight, shingled, and plastered, measuring ten feet wide by fifteen feet long, and eight feet high, with a garret, a closet, a large window on each side, two trap doors, one door at the end, and a brick fireplace. 

Here's the exact cost of my house, excluding labor, as I did all the work myself:

- Boards: $8.03½ (mostly shanty boards)
- Refuse shingles: $4.00
- Laths: $1.25
- Two second-hand windows with glass: $2.43
- One thousand old bricks: $4.00
- Two casks of lime: $2.40
- Hair: $0.31
- Mantle-tree iron: $0.15
- Nails: $3.90
- Hinges and screws: $0.14
- Latch: $0.10
- Chalk: $0.01
- Transportation: $1.40 (I carried a good part myself)

Total: $28.12½

These materials, except for the timber, stones, and sand which I claimed by squatter’s right, suffice for the construction. I also built a small wood-shed using leftover materials. I aim to build a grander house on Concord’s main street when it can please me as much and cost no more than my current one.

A student desiring a permanent home can achieve this at a cost no higher than what they currently pay in annual rent. If I appear boastful, it's on behalf of humanity, not myself, and my flaws do not diminish the truth of my statements. Despite prevalent hypocrisy and insincerity, I express myself openly for the benefit of both moral and physical well-being. At Cambridge College, a student room costs thirty dollars annually, offering little space, noisy neighbors, and possibly residing on the fourth floor. Greater wisdom in managing educational expenses could lessen the burden, as current conveniences cost much more than necessary. Education's high fees contrast sharply with the invaluable yet free learning gained from peers.

Typically, colleges are funded by donations and built by contractors who often outsource labor, an approach that burdens future generations. It would be more beneficial if students themselves contributed to such foundations. Avoiding necessary labor for idle leisure only deprives students of valuable life experiences.

Critics might argue against manual labor for students, but practical experience enhances learning as much as theoretical knowledge. Real-life experiments in living can educate youths better than detached academic studies. True education should entail practical life skills, not just theoretical knowledge.

Modern improvements, such as railroads and telegraphs, often prioritize speed over meaningful content. Rapid advancements may yield trivial communications, suggesting that the means have outpaced substantial ends. An obsession with speed and technology can distract from genuine progress and critical reflection.

Some propose I should accumulate money to travel by train, yet I find walking more efficient and enriching. Starting on foot might get me to my destination quicker than working all day just to afford the fare. True freedom and experience often come through simpler, more direct methods.

The relentless pursuit of money for future leisure often leads to a joyless life when the time finally comes to enjoy it. An Englishman who sought wealth in India to live as a poet in England should have simply lived as a poet from the start. Similarly, the laborers who built the railroad might have spent their time more meaningfully.

To support my living expenses, I cultivated nearly three acres of land, planting beans, potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips without using manure, as I didn't own the land. Despite minimal investment and effort, my modest farming venture yielded beans, potatoes, and some other crops.

By the season's end, my farm expenses totaled $14.72½, and my income was $23.44, leaving a modest profit of $8.71½. This simple yet sustainable approach highlights the value of practical labor and self-sufficiency.

With produce consumed and on hand valued at $4.50, I believe I did better than any farmer in Concord that year, even considering the short duration of my experiment. The following year, I improved further by spading up all the land I needed, about a third of an acre. My experience taught me that living simply and growing only what you consume requires minimal land and effort. It’s cheaper to spade new ground than to use oxen and manure, and seasonal farm work can be done in spare hours, freeing one from reliance on livestock. I was more independent than any farmer in Concord, following my own inclinations without being tied to a house or farm.

I think men are less the keepers of herds than herds are the keepers of men. Men and oxen exchange work, but oxen have the advantage, as they cover more ground. Only a philosopher’s nation, living simply, would avoid using animals for labor. Although such a nation has never existed, it gives perspective on how animals can impose limits on human freedom. Many public works could have been achieved without animal labor, enabling even greater achievements.

Farmers often measure their prosperity by the size of their barns rather than their homes, showing how tied they are to their animals. While there are substantial buildings here, there are few spaces for free worship or speech. Nations should aim to commemorate themselves through intellectual achievements rather than extravagant architecture. Admiring ancient ruins misses the point; a small stone wall around an honest man’s field is more meaningful than grand monuments.

Most nations build grandly for vanity, investing in structures that serve mainly as tombs. The true folly is in constructing monuments like the Pyramids, driven by the ambition of a few at the expense of many. It’s better to polish manners and live sensibly than to aim for such empty grandeur. The effort spent on massive stone structures could be better used to cultivate virtues and intellect.

Concerning my earnings, through various trades in the village including surveying and carpentry, I made $13.34. For food over eight months, from July 4th to March 1st, my expenses were:

- Rice: $1.73½
- Molasses: $1.73
- Rye meal: $1.04¾
- Indian meal: $0.99¾
- Pork: $0.22

Failed experiments:

Flour: 0.88 (Costlier than Indian meal)

Sugar: 0.80

Lard: 0.65

Apples: 0.25

Dried apple: 0.22

Sweet potatoes: 0.10

One pumpkin: 0.06

One watermelon: 0.02

Salt: 0.03

Yes, I did spend $8.74 on food, but I admit it knowing my readers are probably equally guilty, and their actions would look no better in print. The next year, I occasionally caught fish for dinner and even killed a woodchuck that was ruining my bean-field to eat it experimentally. Despite a momentary enjoyment, I realized this was not a good practice, even if it seemed convenient to have your woodchucks prepared by a butcher.

Clothing and incidental expenses during the same period, though not very telling, amounted to $8.40¾.

Oil and some household utensils cost $2.00.

The total expenses, excluding washing and mending, were as follows:

- House: $28.12½
- Farm (one year): $14.72½
- Food (eight months): $8.74
- Clothing, etc. (eight months): $8.40¾
- Oil, etc. (eight months): $2.00

Total: $61.99¾

To my readers who need to earn a living, I have made:

- From farm produce: $23.44
- From day labor: $13.34

Total: $36.78

A balance of $25.21¾ remained on one side, nearly matching my starting funds and projected expenses. On the other side, besides gaining leisure, independence, and health, I secured a comfortable home for as long as I wanted.

Though these statistics may seem accidental and thus unreliable, their completeness gives them value. I account for everything given to me. My food expenses were about twenty-seven cents a week, consisting mainly of rye and Indian meal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a little salt pork, molasses, and water. Given my admiration for Indian philosophy, a diet of rice suited me. To those who argue against my modest dining habits, I clarify that dining out occasionally disrupted my domestic routines but didn't affect this comparative statement.

From my two-year experience, I learned that obtaining necessary food is surprisingly simple and inexpensive. A dish of purslane from my cornfield, boiled and salted, often made a satisfactory dinner. During peaceful times, boiled sweet-corn with salt is sufficient for any reasonable person. Men often starve not from a lack of necessities but for want of luxuries. I even know a woman who believes her son died from drinking only water.

I focus more on economic rather than dietetic perspectives, advising against my abstemious diet unless one has a well-stocked larder. Initially, I made bread from Indian meal and salt, which I baked outdoors. Eventually, I found a mix of rye and Indian meal most convenient. Baking small loaves in cold weather provided amusement, akin to an Egyptian tending hatching eggs. I studied bread-making from its earliest methods to modern-day leavening processes, appreciating bread's historical significance.

Bread leaven, like the vestal fire, was traditionally deemed essential, yet I discovered even this wasn’t necessary. I managed without it, despite warnings from housewives and elderly people predicting health declines. Man, more than any other animal, can adapt to various climates and circumstances. My bread included no added acids or alkalis. Instead, I followed an ancient recipe, simply mixing meal and water, kneading thoroughly, and baking.

Any New Englander can grow their own breadstuffs, avoiding dependency on fluctuating markets. Yet, in places like Concord, fresh meal is rarely sold, and hominy and coarse corn are scarcely used. Farmers often feed their grain to livestock and buy less wholesome, costlier flour. I found that I could easily grow rye and corn, grind them myself, and substitute rice and pork. For a sweetener, I made molasses from pumpkins or beets and planned to tap maples in the future.

By producing my food, needing only clothing and fuel remained. My current pants were woven by a farmer’s family, reflecting the virtue still present in man. In a new country, fuel is abundant. If I could no longer squat, I could buy an acre for the modest price I paid for my cultivated land. However, my presence increased the land's value.

Some skeptics question if I can live on a vegetarian diet alone. To address faith as the core issue, I quip that I can subsist on board nails. Experiments like a young man living on raw corn for two weeks are worthwhile; the squirrel tribe manages it, and the human race benefits from such trials, despite concerns from some quarters.

My furniture, some made by myself and the rest acquired at no cost, included a bed, table, desk, three chairs, a small looking-glass, tongs and andirons, a kettle, skillet, frying-pan, dipper, wash-bowl, two knives and forks, three plates, one cup, spoon, oil jug, molasses jug, and a japanned lamp. No one needs to sit on a pumpkin; there are plenty of suitable chairs in village attics, freely available to anyone willing to take them. I thank God that I can sit and stand without a furniture warehouse. A philosopher alone might not be ashamed to see his furniture carted away, exposed to the elements and eyes of men—a pitiful sight of empty boxes. Such is Spaulding’s furniture, indistinguishable between the rich and the poor; it always looks impoverished. More possessions make one poorer; every load resembles the contents of many shanties combined.

We often move to rid ourselves of furniture, leaving it behind for burning. It’s like carrying traps strapped to a man’s waist, impeding his movement over rugged terrain. A fox losing its tail in a trap or a muskrat gnawing off a leg symbolizes freedom. The loss of man’s elasticity reflects the burden of his possessions. When asked, “What do you mean by a dead set?” If you are perceptive, you will see a man’s belongings, and the clutter he pretends to disown, following him like a burden. A man is at a dead end when he passes through a tight spot, leaving behind a sledge load of furniture. Compassion arises when someone speaks of their furniture insurance as if it were essential. An immigrant struggling under his load is pitied not because it’s all he has, but because he must carry it all. If one must drag a trap, it should be a light one that doesn’t harm.

At no cost for curtains, I have no viewers to shut out but the sun and moon. They neither spoil my milk nor damage my furniture. Warmth from the sun is preferable to adding items to housekeeping. A lady’s offer for a mat was declined as I had no space or time for it; I prefer to wipe my feet on the sod. Avoiding small evils is best.

At a deacon’s auction, mostly trumpery from his father's day remained, including a dried tapeworm. Instead of burning these items, they were sold and moved to new attics and dust holes. Upon death, a man disperses his dust. Some savage nations practice annual renewal; perhaps we should imitate such customs. Bartram describes the Mucclasse Indians' “busk” or “feast of first fruits,” where they burn old belongings and cleanse their houses, ending with new fire and fasting. The Mexicans had a similar ritual every fifty-two years, believing the world was ending. Such ceremonies, outward signs of inner grace, likely stem from divine inspiration despite the lack of biblical record.

For over five years, I sustained myself solely through manual labor, discovering that six weeks of work annually covered my living expenses. The rest of the year was free for study. I tried teaching but found my expenses exceeded my income and required conforming to certain standards, losing precious time. Teaching for mere livelihood, not altruism, proved futile. I also ventured into trade but realized it would take a decade to establish, potentially leading me astray. Instead, I considered simpler pursuits like picking huckleberries, which required little capital and distraction, or gathering wild herbs and evergreens to sell to villagers. However, I learned that commerce taints everything, even noble endeavors.

Valuing my freedom, I chose not to work for luxuries or elaborate homes. Those who thrive on labor for its own sake, or to avoid mischief, are free to do so. Those unsure what to do with leisure should work harder until they earn their freedom. For myself, day labor offered the most independence, requiring just thirty or forty days a year for support, leaving the rest of the time for personal pursuits, unlike employers who work year-round without respite.

Through faith and experience, I’m convinced that sustaining oneself is enjoyable if we live simply and wisely, akin to simpler nations' sports. It's not essential to toil excessively unless it's easy for us.

A young acquaintance thought he could live as I did if he had the means. I don’t recommend anyone imitate my lifestyle because I might change it; rather, everyone should find their unique path. Let each pursue their own desires rather than follow others’.

What's true for one often holds truer for many, just as a larger house isn't proportionally more expensive than a smaller one. I preferred solitude and found it cheaper to build alone. True cooperation is rare and essentially invisible. Faithful cooperation manifests everywhere, while those lacking faith live conventionally. High or low cooperation means living together harmoniously. I recently heard of two young men planning to travel—one working his way, the other with financial security—but they would soon part ways as their approaches differ. The independent man can start immediately, while the one waiting for another may face delays.

Some of my townsmen call this attitude selfish. I admit I haven't indulged much in philanthropic work, sacrificing such pleasures for a sense of duty. People have tried to persuade me to support a poor family, but if I had nothing else to do, I might consider it. When I’ve offered to help some poor individuals as comfortably as I live, they have preferred to remain poor. While many of my townsfolk are dedicated to helping others, I believe some should pursue other interests. One must have a talent for charity as for anything else. I’ve tried doing good and find it doesn’t align with my nature. I wouldn't abandon my calling to meet society's demands, just as steadfastness elsewhere maintains the universe. I respect those dedicated to charity and say, persevere, even if misunderstood.

I believe many readers could relate to my stance. I'm good at doing something—though it’s up to my employer to identify it—but the good I do is often unintended and separate from my main path. People often advise starting where you are, doing good with kindness. If I preached on this, I’d say, focus on being good, rather than doing good. Like the sun, which grows brighter and benefits the world by following its path, we should aim to improve ourselves naturally.

If someone aimed to do me good, I'd avoid them like a deadly wind. I prefer natural suffering over someone’s forced goodness. A person is not good to me just because they might feed me if I'm starving or pull me out of a ditch. A Newfoundland dog could do as much. True philanthropy isn’t just about helping when convenient but when it truly matters. Meetings on philanthropy never seem to focus on aiding people like me.

The Jesuits were perplexed by Indians who, when tortured, suggested new methods of torment. Those superior to physical pain and indifferent to how they were treated found missionary consolation meaningless. The principle of treating others as you want to be treated held no sway over them.

Aid the poor by providing what they truly need, which might just be your example. When giving money, invest yourself in the gesture, not just the cash. Sometimes, the poor suffer more from their chosen lifestyle than from sheer misfortune. If you give money, it might only buy more rags. I pitied cold Irish laborers until one, laden with layers of dirty clothes, refused my offer of extra garments. Suddenly, I pitied myself more, seeing my own discomfort. Often, those who spend the most time and money on the needy might inadvertently contribute to the problem. It’s like a pious slave breeder using money from every tenth slave for Sunday freedom. Employing the poor in kitchens isn’t as kind as working there yourself. Some boast of spending a tenth of their income on charity; perhaps they should consider spending nine-tenths. Society retains only a fraction of wealth, not due to the generosity of the rich but the leniency of justice.

Philanthropy is often overvalued due to our selfishness. A robust poor man once praised a fellow townsman for being kind to the poor, meaning himself. Society values generous benefactors more than genuine spiritual leaders. A learned lecturer on England, after listing her great figures like Shakespeare and Newton, placed Christian heroes like Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry above all, which felt falsely elevated. These were not England’s greatest but perhaps her best philanthropists.

While philanthropy deserves praise, we must also honor all who bless mankind with their lives and works. A man's uprightness and benevolence are like his stem and leaves; however, I seek the flower and fruit—a constant, effortless goodness that subtly enriches our interactions. True charity hides many faults. Often, philanthropists impose their own past sorrows on others, labeling it sympathy. We should share our strength, not our despair, and ensure we don't spread negativity.

Reformers, often driven by their own discontent, attempt to "fix" the world. A man with personal discomfort sees the world’s flaws as green apples, ripe for reform, and embarks on widespread philanthropic missions. Through these acts, he finds personal relief, as if curing his own ills while slightly improving the world.

What saddens reformers may be their private woes, not true empathy with others’ distress. Personal renewal can lead them to abandon their benevolent efforts. I avoid lecturing against vices I haven't experienced. If you engage in philanthropy, do so discreetly. Save lives and manage your tasks with equal ease. Seek meaningful work rather than overseeing the poor.

Our society’s manners suffer from hypocritical sanctity, where hymn-books echo melodious curses rather than simple joy in life. Records lack genuine satisfaction with life’s gifts or praise of God. All distant success uplifts me, while disease and failure bring sadness. To truly restore mankind, we must first embody nature’s simplicity and health ourselves, clearing our own clouds and absorbing life. Strive to be a worthy individual, not just an administrator of aid.

In Sheik Sadi's "Gulistan," they ask why only the cypress, fruitless yet ever-flourishing, is called azad or free. The wise man answers that while other trees bloom and wither seasonally, the cypress remains evergreen. Similarly, true independents flourish regardless of circumstances. If you have abundance, be generous like the date tree; if not, be free and constant like the cypress.

The Pretensions of Poverty

"You presume too much, poor wretch, to claim a place in the heavens because your humble home fosters lazy or pedantic virtues under cheap sunshine or by shady springs with roots and pot-herbs. By tearing humane passions from the mind, which nourish virtues, you degrade nature and dull the senses, like a Gorgon turning men to stone.

We do not need the dull company of your forced temperance or unnatural numbness that feels neither joy nor sorrow, nor your falsely exalted passive fortitude over active virtues. Your lowly kind settles in mediocrity, becoming servile, while we honor virtues allowing for excess: brave deeds, regal splendor, all-seeing wisdom, boundless magnanimity, and heroic virtue unmatched by antiquity, exemplified only by figures like Hercules, Achilles, and Theseus. Return to your loathed cell, and when you see the enlightened realm, strive to understand the greatness of those worthies."

Where I Lived, and What I Lived For

At a certain point, we consider every spot as a potential homesite. I've surveyed the countryside around my home, imagining buying every available farm, knowing their prices, and envisaging living on each one. I walked the land, tasted wild apples, talked about husbandry, mentally bought the farms, and then left, content after my imaginary ownership. This habit made friends see me as a sort of real-estate broker. Wherever I sat felt like home to me, and any place could house me for an hour, a season, or longer. Future settlers should know their homesites have been pre-visited in my dreams. I envisioned orchards, woods, and pastures, deciding which trees to keep or discard, then let the land lie fallow because true wealth lies in leaving things alone.

My imagination was so vivid that I even had informal refusals on several farms but never took actual possession, avoiding any risk. The closest I came to owning property was the Hollowell place. I sorted seeds and gathered materials to start working on it. However, the owner's wife changed her mind, and he offered me $10 to void our agreement. With only ten cents to my name, I let him keep the farm and the money, considering it a fair trade for my imaginary investment. Essentially, I gave him the farm for what I paid and made a symbolic gift of $10; I was richer in experience without losing my ten cents, seeds, or wheelbarrow supplies. I continued to enjoy the landscape's yields without the burden of ownership.

As for the Hollowell farm, its secluded location, about two miles from the village and half a mile from the nearest neighbor, appealed to me. It was bounded by a river, which supposedly protected it from spring frosts. I loved its gray, dilapidated house and barn, rickety fences, and old, gnawed apple trees—it separated me from past occupants. My earliest memories of the place, hidden behind red maples with its dog barking, were precious. I wanted to buy it before the owner made further changes, eager to experience its rare qualities.

Farm ownership, to me, meant being prepared with seeds, which supposedly improve with age. I believe time filters good seeds from bad, and my eventual planting would be more successful. My advice is to live as free and uncommitted as possible, whether tied to a farm or not. Cato's advice on buying a farm echoes my thoughts: examine it thoroughly, and its appeal grows. I'll continue to circle my ideal farm in mind indefinitely, content to be buried in it someday, enhancing its final allure.

I want to describe an extended experiment over two years by combining my experiences for simplicity. I aim not to lament but to boast energetically, hoping to awaken my neighbors.

When I first moved to the woods on Independence Day, July 4, 1845, my house was unfinished, just a rain shelter without plaster or a chimney. The rough, weather-stained boards with wide chinks made it cool at night. The clean, airy look of the upright white studs and freshly planed door and window casings, especially in the morning dews, reminded me of a house on a mountain I had visited. This cabin felt as airy and untouched, inviting even the gods. The winds passing over made celestial music, as if Olympus itself surrounded my dwelling.

Previously, I had owned only a tent, used during summer excursions, which now sits in my garret. My boat, once passed from hand to hand, has drifted through time. This more permanent shelter marked some progress in settling down. The frame, lightly clad, felt like a crystallization around me, offering the fresh air of the outdoors within. Even in the rainiest weather, I felt as if I were outside, just behind a door. Birds, not imprisoned but living freely around me, brought the wilderness closer. I found myself near garden birds and the thrilling songsters of the forest—the wood-thrush, veery, scarlet tanager, field-sparrow, and whippoorwill.

Situated by a small pond, about a mile and a half south of Concord and near Lincoln, my location felt like a secluded mountain tarn. The sunrise revealed the pond, its mists retreating like ghosts, and dew clinging to the trees. This pond, particularly valuable during August rainstorms, offered serene reflections, turning it into a lower heaven. From a nearby hilltop, recently cleared, I enjoyed vistas southward to blue-tinged distant hills. Standing on tiptoe, I glimpsed even more distant mountain ranges and part of the village, though in most directions, the surrounding woods confined the view.

Despite the limited view from my door, I never felt confined, my imagination roamed freely. The low shrub-oak plateau opposite stretched toward vast prairies and steppes, providing ample space for all. As Damodara said, "There are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vast horizon."

Both place and time changed, bringing me closer to the parts of the universe and history that fascinated me. My home felt as remote as regions viewed by astronomers, a peaceful, untouched corner of the cosmos. Living near stars like the Pleiades or Aldebaran, I felt equally distant from my former existence, barely visible to my nearest neighbor. It was a secluded spot in creation.

Each morning invited me to live with simplicity and innocence, akin to Nature herself. I revered Aurora like the Greeks, rising early to bathe in the pond, a religious exercise that renewed me daily. Morning revived the heroic ages, and even the faint hum of a mosquito at dawn stirred me as deeply as any trumpet of fame. The morning, the day's most memorable time, awakens a part of us that slumbers through the rest of the day. A day started with genuine aspiration and celestial music could achieve higher purposes than one started mechanically.

The belief in the sacredness of each day's early hour is essential; without it, one descends into despair. Each day’s reinvigoration offers the soul a chance for nobler life. Memorable events happen in the morning. Poets, heroes, and all significant actions emerge at sunrise. For those whose thoughts rise with the sun, the day is perpetually morning. True awakening is to be fully alive, to strive for intellectual and divine life.

We must learn to remain awake through an infinite expectation of dawn, even in our deepest sleep. The ability to elevate life through conscious effort is encouraging. Creating beauty in the atmosphere and our perspective is the highest art—more so than painting or sculpture. Affecting the day’s quality is each person’s task. 

I went to the woods to live deliberately, to face life’s essential facts, and not, on dying, discover I hadn’t lived. I wanted to live deeply, to strip life to its core, be it mean or sublime, and understand it fully. Most people seem uncertain about life’s true nature, hastily concluding it’s to “glorify God and enjoy him forever.” I sought to know life by experience and share its truth.

We live meanly, like ants, despite fables of our transformation into men. We fight like pygmies against cranes, compounding errors and unnecessary misery. Our lives are consumed by trivialities. An honest man should need only his fingers, or maybe toes, to count his affairs. Embrace simplicity—let your concerns be few. In this chaotic life, full of distractions, living without clarity risks sinking into oblivion. Simplify everything: meals, possessions, and tasks. Life is like a fragmented confederacy, resembling a bloated, mismanaged nation cluttered with luxuries and waste. Our sole remedy is Spartan simplicity and a noble purpose.

We hasten through life, starving ourselves prematurely. The maxim "a stitch in time saves nine" is misapplied; we make countless stitches today for minor future gains. True work is nonexistent; we are like dancers in frenzy, unable to be still. A mere bell toll can divert even the busiest, revealing a deep hunger for diversion, not duty. After a nap, men eagerly seek news, as though they guard the world in their sleep.

News and the post-office are overrated; few letters are worth their postage, and most news is mere gossip. One instance of crime or disaster suffices; more adds nothing valuable. Philosophically, all news is trivial, and its consumers are akin to gossipy old women. People rush for the latest updates, but true novelty is rare. News could be written years in advance with minimal inaccuracy—certain patterns repeat predictably.

What is truly newsworthy? The timeless and unchanging deserve attention. A dignitary once sought news from a philosopher, who responded that his master aimed to reduce his faults but never managed to. This simple exchange highlights a noble pursuit.

Instead of dreary Sunday sermons, preachers should thunder a call to reflection: "Pause! Slow down, for in seeking speed, we become lethargic."

Shams and delusions are often mistaken for truths, while reality appears fantastical. If people observed only realities without being deluded, life would resemble a fairy tale. Respecting only what is inevitable and rightful would make music and poetry echo in our streets. When calm and wise, we see that only significant things have permanent existence; petty fears and pleasures are mere shadows of reality. This realization is exhilarating and sublime. By ignoring reality and accepting illusions, people live routine lives based on falsehoods. Children, who play at life, understand its true laws better than adults, who, after failing, mistakenly believe they are wiser.

A Hindoo book tells of a king’s son expelled in infancy, raised by a forester, and believing he was part of the barbarous tribe. Once discovered by his father’s minister and revealed to be a prince, his misconception was corrected. Similarly, the soul mistakenly perceives its nature until enlightened by a holy teacher to know itself as Brahma.

In New England, people lead mediocre lives because they don’t see beyond appearances. A man observing only reality would find familiar places unrecognizable. True perceptions would deconstruct the facades of meeting houses, courthouses, jails, shops, and homes. People think truth lies far away, but it exists here and now. God is present in every moment, and we can perceive the sublime and noble through an awareness of surrounding reality. The universe responds to our perceptions, guiding us whether we move fast or slow. We should live focused on conceiving great ideas, as future generations can realize them.

Live each day as deliberately as Nature, unaffected by minor disturbances. Rise early, move calmly, let events come and go without disruption. Face life without being overwhelmed by daily routines. With determination, navigate life’s challenges, maintaining focus like Ulysses tied to the mast. Ignore distractions and reflect on their nature, settling into our purpose by overcoming opinions, prejudices, traditions, illusions, and appearances. Dig down to the foundation of reality, establishing a firm ground we can build upon, measuring how deeply shams have accumulated over time. Facing facts directly, we see their truth and conclude our lives contentedly. Whether in life or death, we seek only reality. If dying, let us fully experience it; if alive, let us go about our business.

Time is a stream I fish in. Drinking from it, I see the sandy bottom and realize its shallowness. Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains. I wish to drink deeper, to fish in the sky where stars pebble the bottom. I may not know everything, but my intellect discerns truths. I prefer mental labor to physical. My mind is an organ for exploring, like a creature’s snout and paws, using it to dig through life’s complexities. I believe a rich vein of truth is nearby, and here I will begin my search.

Reading

With more thoughtful choices in their pursuits, everyone could become keen observers and learners, as our nature and destiny intrigue us all. Pursuing property, creating a family or state, or seeking fame makes us mortal, but engaging with truth grants us immortality, safe from change. Both ancient Egyptian and Hindu philosophers glimpsed divine truths, and these revelations remain as vibrant today. The divine is timeless, beyond past, present, or future.

Living in solitude enhanced my thoughts and serious reading more than any university could. Despite being far from a typical library, I accessed enduring works, first written on bark and now on paper. Poet Mîr Camar Uddîn Mast noted that exploring spiritual realms through books is as intoxicating as fine wine. I kept Homer’s "Iliad" on hand, reading sparingly amid relentless manual labor like building my house and tending beans. Though physically demanding, the anticipation of future reading sustained me. Reading shallow travel books during breaks eventually embarrassed me, making me question my living conditions.

Studying classical works like Homer or Æschylus in original languages safeguards against indulgence; it encourages emulation of heroic virtues. Such books, even when translated, often speak in a language dead to modern, degenerate times, requiring effort to grasp their profound meanings. Despite modern translations, classical authors remain as exclusive and revered as ever. Learning ancient languages is valuable, elevating mundane words into lasting symbols of wisdom. Classic literature, containing humanity’s noblest thoughts, endures as the only reliable oracles, answering even contemporary questions. Ignoring ancient wisdom due to its age is as absurd as ignoring Nature. Reading well, with a true spirit, demands rigorous training akin to athletic preparation, a lifelong commitment. Books should be read with the same deliberate care with which they were written.

Mere fluency in a language doesn’t suffice; there’s a significant gap between spoken and written forms. Spoken language is transient, almost primal, learned unconsciously. Written language, however, embodies maturity and experience, representing a reserved, profound expression. In the Middle Ages, those speaking Greek or Latin often couldn’t comprehend literature in those languages. Only when European nations developed their unique literatures did scholars appreciate ancient texts. Today, few still read these treasures, which remain unknown to the average reader.

Though we may admire oratory, the finest written words surpass spoken language, akin to the stars beyond clouds. Writers speak to the intellect across ages, while orators capture fleeting moments, addressing immediate audiences. True eloquence resides in writing, enduring beyond the momentary inspiration of the orator.

Alexander carried the Iliad in a precious casket on his expeditions, valuing the written word as a cherished relic. Text is more intimate and universal than any other art form, capturing life itself. It can be translated into every language and uttered by all, turning ancient thoughts into modern speech. Grecian literature, like their marbles, has matured over millennia, preserving its celestial essence against time. Books are the world's treasured wealth, inherited across generations and fitting for every cottage. Without advocating for themselves, they enlighten and sustain readers, granting their authors a natural aristocracy influencing society more profoundly than rulers.

When individuals achieve leisure through hard work, they often seek intellectual circles, recognizing their own cultural gaps. Sensibly, they ensure their children receive the education they lacked, thus founding intellectual dynasties. Those who haven't read ancient classics in their original languages miss out on a vital history of humanity, as no modern translation fully captures their essence. Ancient works like those of Homer, Æschylus, and Virgil are unmatched in beauty and craftsmanship. Later writers rarely achieve their level of meticulous artistry. Forgetting these works would be a loss until we possess the wisdom to appreciate them adequately.

Humanity has yet to fully read great poets, as only great poets can truly comprehend them, much like the stars are observed but not understood by many. Most people read for convenience, not as a noble intellectual exercise, which requires alert and wakeful engagement. Learning to read should lead us to the best literature, rather than confining us to basic texts.

Most people are content with easy reading, often reducing their intellectual engagement to the wisdom of one book, like the Bible, while consuming trivial tales. Such stories, like "The Skip of the Tip-Toe-Hop," attract readers with their sensationalism but offer no intellectual growth, leading to dullness and a decline in critical faculties. This type of literature is abundantly produced and consumed, overshadowing more nourishing works.

Many so-called good readers do not engage with the best books. In Concord, there is little interest in high-quality English literature, and even the well-educated lack familiarity with English classics or ancient wisdom. Few make efforts to truly understand profound works. For instance, a middle-aged woodchopper in Concord reads a French paper not for news but to maintain his language skills. This dedication to language is more than most college graduates achieve, who often only read basic English papers.

If someone reads an excellent English or ancient classic, they find few people to discuss it with, illustrating a significant gap in cultural and intellectual engagement. Even professors may master a language but not the deeper wit and poetry of its literature. And regarding sacred texts, many are unaware of scriptures beyond the Hebrew Bible.

Concord's people prioritize easy reading and light stories over profound literature, keeping intellectual pursuits at a low level. Aspiring to engage with the wisdom of historical figures like Plato seems foreign, even though their works are accessible. This disconnect between our education and true intellectual engagement leaves little distinction between those who cannot read and those who only read simple texts.

Books can profoundly impact lives, offering wisdom that could change perspectives and solve age-old dilemmas. Many wise men have addressed the same questions that puzzle us, and studying their works could foster both wisdom and liberality. For example, a reflective farmhand might learn from ancient sages like Zoroaster, understanding that transformative experiences are universal.

Claiming progress in the 19th century, Concord does little to cultivate intellectual growth. There is a lack of advanced educational institutions and cultural investments compared to other nations or historical eras. Although the town spends on physical infrastructure, it neglects intellectual development.

For Concord to truly benefit from modern advancements, it needs to invest in education and culture. Villages should become centers of learning, with opportunities for lifelong education and intellectual pursuits. Rather than relying on commercial publishers or limited local resources, Concord should access global knowledge and invite great minds to teach. This vision for an "uncommon school" promotes the idea of building a community of intellectually rich, culturally refined individuals, elevating society beyond provincial limitations.

Sounds

Relying solely on books, even the most select and classic, limits our understanding of the universal language spoken by all things and events. While much is published, little is printed in the true sense. Natural and spontaneous experiences cannot be replaced by any method or discipline. The essence of life is to always observe and engage directly with what is around us. Will you merely be a reader or will you become a seer? Understand your fate, observe what lies ahead, and move confidently into the future.

During my first summer, instead of reading books, I hoed beans. At times, rather than prioritizing work, I cherished peaceful moments. I value having a broad margin to my life. Many mornings, after my bath, I would sit in my sunny doorway from sunrise until noon, engrossed in reverie amid the trees and quiet, while birds sang or moved silently through my house. The sun's position or a distant traveler's wagon would remind me of the passage of time. During these moments, I grew like corn at night, gaining more from contemplation than from any physical labor. These were not wasted hours but added to my life, reflecting an Oriental understanding of contemplation and forsaking work. The days passed seamlessly without concern for time, bringing a sense of fortune and gratitude. My days were not defined by hours or named after deities; instead, I lived like the Puri Indians, who use a single word for yesterday, today, and tomorrow, expressing time through gestures. Though my fellow-townsmen may have seen this as idleness, by nature's standard, I thrived. A man must find his occasions in himself, as the natural day is calm and doesn't condemn indolence.

My lifestyle provided an advantage over those seeking amusement in society or theaters. My life became my constant amusement, a never-ending drama full of novel scenes. By consistently pursuing one's passion, one is never bored. Housework turned into a pleasant activity. When my floor was dirty, I'd move my furniture outside, clean the floor, and return everything by the time villagers finished breakfast, hardly interrupting my meditations. It was refreshing to see my belongings outside, resembling a gypsy setup. The sight of sunlight on my things and the free wind blowing was worth the effort. Familiar objects appeared more interesting outdoors. Birds perched nearby, plants grew around my setup, and natural elements scattered around created a harmonious scene, suggesting how these forms inspired our furniture.

My house, on a hillside near the woods and pond, was surrounded by natural beauty. In my yard grew various plants and shrubs. In late May, the path to the pond was adorned with sand-cherry blossoms. Though not very palatable, I tasted them to honor Nature. The luxurious sumach around my house grew rapidly, pushing up through the embankment. Its tropical leaves were a pleasant sight. In spring, dry sticks transformed magically into lush green boughs, sometimes breaking under their own weight. By August, the berries turned crimson, attracting wild bees and bending the delicate branches with their weight.

This summer afternoon, as I sit by my window, hawks circle above, and wild pigeons fly and perch restlessly on the pine boughs, filling the air with their presence. A fishhawk plucks a fish from the pond, a mink catches a frog by the shore, and reed-birds flutter among the sedge. For the past half hour, I’ve heard the rhythm of railroad cars, a sound connecting the rural with the bustle of Boston. Unlike a boy I knew, who fled the isolation of a farm, our village now intersects with a railroad, linking us to the wider world.

The Fitchburg Railroad runs a hundred rods south of my dwelling, and I often walk along its path to the village. I’ve become a familiar sight to the men on the freight trains, who consider me part of the railway family, as I would gladly be.

The locomotive’s whistle pierces my woods, heralding the arrival of city merchants and country traders. Its presence brings essential goods and news, a conduit of commerce linking urban and rural life. The train's relentless movement, resembling a comet with its streaming vapor, evokes a sense of cosmic journeying.

The locomotive, with its thunderous snorts and fire-breathing nostrils, is a symbol of human ambition harnessing nature’s elements. If only these industrial feats were as noble as their execution, they could be as beneficial as a farmer’s honest toil.

Observing the morning trains feels like witnessing the sunrise, their vapor trails stretching skyward, momentarily shading my fields. The iron horse, prepared meticulously in the early hours, symbolizes unwavering industry. Fire is stoked to animate it, and snow is plowed to clear its path. The train tirelessly crosses the country, hauling goods and people, pausing only briefly to rest.

These trains traverse remote woods, stopping at bustling stations and haunting desolate swamps. Their schedules have become central to village life, their punctuality setting the standard for local timekeeping, possibly improving people's punctuality and efficiency. The phrase "railroad fashion" signifies a new era of promptness and urgency. There is no leniency, no delays, just steadfast movement towards predetermined destinations. We live with this newfound precision, always aware of the unseen yet unavoidable trains of fate, urging us to stay on our paths.

I admire commerce for its enterprise and bravery. Unlike those who pray to Jupiter, I see people daily conducting their business with courage and contentment, often achieving more than they realize. Their steady and cheerful valor, especially those working with snow-ploughs in harsh winters, impresses me more than the heroism displayed at Buena Vista. They possess not only the rare 3 A.M. courage but also the endurance to work until their iron steed is frozen. Even amidst a great snowstorm, I hear their engine bell through the fog, signaling the train's arrival despite a New England snowstorm’s attempt to halt it. Covered in snow, these workers resemble Sierra Nevada boulders.

Commerce is unexpectedly confident, serene, alert, adventurous, and tireless. Its natural methods contribute to its success, unlike many fanciful ventures. The freight train's passage, wafting scents from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, refreshes and expands my world view. I feel connected to distant lands, like tropical climes and vast oceans, witnessing items like palm leaves, Manila hemp, and old sails narrating their stormy history.

Lumber from Maine, risen in value due to scarcity, Thomaston lime reaching far hills, and bales of rags destined to become paper, all tell stories of real life. A car of salt fish evokes the perseverance of saints and its many uses, remaining unspoiled through time. Spanish hides, curing obstinacy into glue, highlight the persistence of natural dispositions. A hogshead of molasses or brandy, destined for a Vermont trader, brings visions of commerce.

Tall pines hewn on northern hills, rushing to become the mast of a great ship, and cattle trains transporting sheep and oxen, transform a pastoral valley into a mobile spectacle. Shepherds, drovers, and lost dogs evoke a sense of a displaced pastoral life. 

The ringing bell reminds me to step aside for the trains, but I see the railroad as a minor disruption in the landscape, crossing it like a mere path in the woods. I refuse to let its smoke and noise spoil my senses.

Now that the cars are gone and the world quiet, I find myself more alone than ever. The long afternoon is occasionally interrupted by the faint sound of a distant carriage.

On Sundays, I sometimes hear church bells from Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or Concord, their melody faint and sweet, blending with nature. The sound, carrying over the woods, becomes a hum, as if the pine needles were strings of a harp. All distant sounds produce a similar effect, a universal vibration, much like distant ridges appear bluish. It is as though each element of the forest had taken up and echoed the sound, transforming the bell's repetition into the voice of the wood, like a wood-nymph singing.

In the evening, the distant lowing of a cow, which I sometimes mistook for minstrels, blended into a natural music. Regularly, at half past seven during summer, whippoorwills sang by my door or house, beginning within five minutes of sunset each night. I even noted their habits, hearing four or five at different parts of the wood, their clucks and buzzing near me.

When other birds were silent, screech owls filled the air with their mournful cries, reminiscent of ancient wailing. These sounds, grave and solemn, were unlike the "tu-whit tu-who" of poems. They were the music of fallen souls, now repenting with their wailing hymns. The harmony of their cries provided a sense of nature's variety and capacity.

I also heard a hooting owl, whose melancholy sound seemed like the dying moans of a human, blending with ghoulish and sorrowful tones. However, when heard from afar, the sound was pleasing, suggesting different associations.

Owls, with their idiotic and maniacal hooting, suited the swamps and twilight woods, suggesting an undisturbed nature. All day the sun shone on a savage swamp, but a different race of creatures expressed nature's meaning at night.

Late in the evening, the distant rumbling of wagons, the baying of dogs, and the lowing of cows became audible. The shores echoed with the trumpeting of bullfrogs, reminiscent of ancient revelers, whose mockingly merry sounds now filled the night.

I rarely heard cock-crowing from my clearing and considered keeping a rooster for its remarkable note. It would surpass the goose's clangor and the owl's hoots. The idea of wild cockerels crowing in the woods seemed invigorating, a call to rise early and live healthily.

Without domestic animals or noises like churns or crying children, an old-fashioned man might have gone mad here. Instead, I had squirrels on the roof, whippoorwills, blue-jays, hares, screech-owls, geese, loons, and foxes. No cockerels or hens, just unfenced nature and a young forest overtaking the yard. Instead of domestic paths, there were wild sumacs breaking into the cellar and pines creaking against the house. Only raw nature met the doorstep—no gate, no front yard, just a direct path to wilderness.

Solitude

This is a delightful evening, when every sense is alive, absorbing delight through every pore. I wander freely in Nature, feeling part of her. Walking along the stony shore of the pond in my shirt sleeves, despite the cool, cloudy, and windy weather, the elements unusually resonate with me. The bullfrogs trumpet to welcome the night, and the whippoorwill's call carries on the rippling wind over the water. The rustling alder and poplar leaves take my breath away, yet like the lake, my serenity is unshaken. The evening wind's small waves are far from stormy, just as the smooth reflective surface remains calm. Though dark, the wind still blows through the woods, waves crash, and some creatures soothe the rest with their sounds. Complete repose is elusive. The wildest animals hunt now; foxes, skunks, and rabbits roam freely, nature’s nocturnal guardians, linking the days of life.

Returning to my house, I find visitors have left their marks—a bunch of flowers, a wreath of evergreen, or a name penciled on a leaf or chip. Visitors to the woods often take a small piece with them, intentionally or accidentally leaving traces like a peeled willow wand woven into a ring. I can tell if people have visited in my absence by bent twigs, shoe prints, or even lingering scents of cigars or pipes.

There is ample space around us; our horizon is never at our elbows. The thick wood and pond aren't at our door but are part of a familiar, worn area reclaimed from Nature. I have an expansive range of unfrequented forest for my privacy, with the nearest neighbor a mile away and no visible houses except from the hilltops within half a mile. My horizon is bounded by woods, with distant views of the railroad and fence skirting a woodland road. It is as solitary as the prairies, as remote as Asia or Africa. I have my sun, moon, stars, and a little world to myself. At night, no traveler passes my house or knocks on my door. Occasionally, someone fishes in the pond, but mostly, the night remains unspoiled by human presence. Men still fear the dark, despite modern reassurances.

Yet even for the most melancholy person, Nature offers sweet, tender companionship. No storm is so severe that it doesn't provide music to a healthy, innocent ear. A simple, brave man cannot be forced into vulgar sadness. Enjoying Nature’s friendship, I trust nothing can make life burdensome. The gentle rain today nurtures my beans and keeps me indoors, and, though it stops my hoeing, it is more beneficial than the hoeing itself. Prolonged rain may rot seeds or destroy crops, but it’s good for the grass, and thus good for me. Comparing myself to others, I often feel favored by the gods, with a sense of protection others lack. I have never felt lonely or oppressed by solitude, except briefly after arriving in the woods, when I doubted if human proximity was necessary for serenity. Yet, during a gentle rain, I sensed Nature's infinite friendliness, making human companionship feel insignificant. This connection with Nature, even in wild and dreary scenes, assured me I was never alone.

“Mourning untimely consumes the sad;
Few are their days in the land of the living,
Beautiful daughter of Toscar.”

Some of my most enjoyable moments were spent indoors during spring or fall rainstorms. The continuous roar and pelting of rain, combined with an early twilight, allowed many thoughts to take root and unfold. In those northeast rains that challenged village houses, while maids were on guard with mops, I felt content in my little house, enjoying its shelter. During one thunderstorm, lightning struck a pitch-pine tree across the pond, creating a distinctive spiral groove from top to bottom. Years later, I was still awed by this mark, a reminder of the terrifying lightning bolt from the clear sky eight years prior. People often suggest I must feel lonely out here, especially on rainy or snowy days. I feel tempted to respond that Earth is just a point in space, surrounded by distant stars. Why should I feel lonely when our planet is part of the Milky Way? The true question is what separates people internally. Physical proximity does not bring minds closer. It's more about what we choose to stay near: not other people or busy places, but rather the sources of our spiritual nourishment. This varies, but a wise person digs their cellar near their life's perennial source.

One evening, I met a wealthy townsman who questioned how I could give up life’s comforts. I replied sincerely that I liked my life. After our brief exchange, I went to bed while he continued in the darkness and mud to Brighton. The concept of coming to life, spiritually awakening, can occur anywhere and is always refreshing. We often let external circumstances distract us, but the nearest thing to us is the force shaping our existence. Not our hired help, but the force of creation.

“How vast and profound are Heaven and Earth’s subtle powers. They shape the universe and inspire men to purify their hearts and offer homage to ancestors. These intelligences surround us everywhere.” 

We are part of an intriguing experiment, testing our ability to stay content without gossip. Confucius rightly says, “Virtue does not remain alone; it must have neighbors."

By thinking deeply, we can detach from our actions and their consequences, observing life as if from a distance. We can feel like driftwood in a stream or a deity observing life below. This detachment can sometimes make us poor neighbors. 

To be alone most of the time is healthy. Even the best company becomes tiring. I never found a companion as companionable as solitude. Being among people often feels lonelier than being alone. Solitude isn't about physical distance but mental engagement. The dedicated student in a crowded college is as solitary as a hermit in the desert. A farmer can work alone all day without feeling lonely but needs company at night. In contrast, the student, though physically alone, remains mentally engaged and thus doesn't feel solitary.

Society often undervalues quality interaction, meeting too frequently without gaining new appreciation for each other. We gather multiple times daily, adhering to etiquette to avoid conflicts. Constant interactions, from post-offices to nightly gatherings, diminish our respect for one another. Less frequent meetings would suffice for meaningful communications. For example, factory workers are never alone. One inhabitant per square mile, as where I live, would be ideal. A person's worth is not in physical contact.

A man, lost and dying in the woods, found solace in hallucinations caused by weakness. Similarly, with good health, we can find comfort in a natural, more subtle society and realize we are never truly alone.

I enjoy my solitude, especially in the mornings. I am no lonelier than the pond's vibrant life or Walden Pond itself, which features only 'blue angels' in its waters. The sun stands alone except on rare cloudy days. God is solitary, but the devil has much company. I feel as content as a solitary mullein or dandelion, no lonelier than natural phenomena like streams, weathercocks, stars, winds, or the first spider in a new house.

During winter, an old settler visits, sharing tales of the past and creating pleasant evenings without needing apples or cider. An elderly woman nearby, with a fragrant herb garden, entertains me with her vast memory of fables and history. Despite her age, she thrives in all seasons.

Nature—sun, wind, rain, seasons—offers indescribable innocence and endless beneficence. Nature sympathizes with humanity's grief, affecting even the sun, winds, clouds, and trees. I feel connected to the earth as part of its fabric.

For wellness, we need Nature's timeless, botanical remedies, not artificial concoctions. Instead of patent medicines, let us breathe the fresh morning air, capturing its essence for those who’ve forgotten its benefits. True health comes not from Hygeia’s cup but from Hebe, who symbolizes enduring youth and vitality, bringing perpetual spring wherever she went.

Visitors

I love society and am naturally sociable, ready to engage with anyone I meet. I am no hermit and can endure the most frequent bar-goer if needed.

In my house, I had three chairs: one for solitude, two for friendship, and three for company. When unexpected guests arrived in larger numbers, they made do by standing. Surprisingly, a small house can hold many great people. I've had twenty-five or thirty guests at once, yet we often parted without realizing how close we were. Many homes today are excessively large, with numerous rooms and vast halls, making the inhabitants seem insignificant. At times, blowing a herald's summons before grand establishments like Tremont or Astor House produces only a timid mouse emerging briefly.

One challenge of a small house was finding space to distance myself from guests during deep conversations. Big thoughts need room to be expressed clearly. Just as thoughts need time to stabilize before reaching the listener, our sentences needed space to unfold. Like nations, people need considerable neutral ground between them. I’ve experienced the unique pleasure of speaking to someone across a pond, which offers more room for contemplation. In my small home, we were too close to hear each other properly. It’s like throwing two stones close together in calm water; their waves interfere. For thoughtful conversation, being farther apart allows for better communication. If we desire intimate connection beyond spoken words, we must be silent and physically distant.

My "best" room was actually the pine wood behind my house, always ready for company. On summer days, I would host distinguished guests there, with nature maintaining the space in perfect order.

If one guest arrived, they sometimes joined my simple meal, and our conversation continued seamlessly. But if twenty came, we would naturally practice abstinence, which felt considerate rather than inhospitable. In such instances, physical needs seemed miraculously diminished, allowing me to host countless guests. If anyone ever left my home disappointed or hungry, I sympathized with them deeply. Establishing new, better customs is easier than many believe. A host's reputation need not rest on extravagant dinners. Personally, I avoided houses where elaborate dining felt like a deterrent to future visits. I proudly embrace the lines from Spenser inscribed by a visitor on a walnut leaf card: 

"Arrivéd there, the little house they fill,
Ne looke for entertainment where none was;
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will:
The noblest mind the best contentment has."

When Winslow, later governor of Plymouth Colony, visited Massasoit with a companion, they walked through the woods and, upon arrival, were tired and hungry. Massasoit greeted them warmly but offered no food. At night, they shared a bed with the king and his wife, with other men pressing in due to lack of space. The next day, Massasoit provided two small fish for nearly forty people. They managed one meal in two days and would have gone hungry if not for purchasing a partridge. Worried about their health due to lack of food and sleep from the "savages' barbarous singing," they decided to leave. The scarcity of food wasn’t due to a lack of hospitality but rather the Indians' own limited supplies. On a later visit during plentiful times, food wasn’t an issue.

During my time in the woods, I had more visitors than ever before. The remoteness ensured that only those with genuine interest made the effort to visit, making the company more meaningful. This distance filtered out trivial interactions, bringing only the finest connections to me.

One such visitor was a Canadian woodchopper and post-maker, a simple yet fascinating man who could hole fifty posts a day and once dined on a woodchuck his dog caught. He knew of Homer and read verses, though he perhaps hadn’t read a full book in years. He respected great writers and preachers, seeing their work as miraculous. Despite his lack of formal education, his spirit and humor were infectious.

Dressed in a gray cloth cap, a dingy coat, and cowhide boots, he carried his lunch, often cold meat, in a tin pail, occasionally offering me a drink. He moved at his own pace, caring more for his joy than for the intensity of work. He loved to hunt and spoke of how thick the pigeons were, believing he could live off the land if not for his job.

A skilled chopper, he cut trees expertly to allow regrowth and ease of transport. He often stopped to exchange a few words, his mirth spilling over. He delighted in simple pleasures, rolling on the ground with laughter or firing a pocket pistol for amusement. Sometimes, chickadees perched on him as he ate in the woods, a scene that brought him considerable joy.

Physically robust and mentally content, he seldom felt fatigue. His intellectual and spiritual sides, however, were like those of a child, shaped by minimal education. He revered those with knowledge but saw them as beyond his reach. He respected me as a writer, equating considerable writing with good handwriting, which he possessed. When asked if he wished to write his thoughts, he admitted he hadn't tried, finding the task daunting and concerned about spelling. His simplicity and authenticity defined him more than any formal introduction could.

A wise reformer once asked him if he wanted the world to change. Surprised, he chuckled and replied in his Canadian accent, "No, I like it well enough." His interactions would have intrigued a philosopher. To strangers, he seemed oblivious to general matters, yet I saw in him a blend of wisdom and childlike simplicity. A townsperson likened him, walking through the village whistling in his cap, to a prince in disguise.

His only books were an almanac and an arithmetic, the former serving as his encyclopedia. Discussing contemporary reforms, he viewed them simply and practically. He hadn't considered doing without factories, but noted that Vermont gray homespun was good. As for tea and coffee alternatives, he found hemlock-leaf water better in warm weather. Asked about managing without money, he pointed out its convenience, paralleling philosophical accounts of its origins. He could explain institutions better than most philosophers since he described their practical importance.

Once, upon hearing Plato’s definition of a man as a featherless biped, and the subsequent presentation of a plucked cock as Plato’s man, he humorously noted the reverse-bending knees. He often exclaimed, "How I love to talk! By George, I could talk all day!" When asked after months if he had any new ideas, he replied that working hard made retaining old ideas an accomplishment. He occasionally inquired about my improvements.

One winter day, I suggested an inner substitute for external spiritual guidance. He responded, "Satisfied! Some men are satisfied with different things. One man, if he has enough, may sit by the fire all day, by George!" He never embraced a spiritual view, valuing practical expediency instead. Suggestions for life improvements were met with a resigned "too late," yet he believed firmly in honesty and virtues.

He had an unmistakable originality, thinking and expressing his own ideas, a rarity worth a ten-mile walk to witness. Though often hesitant and inarticulate, his thoughts were significant. His thinking, deeply rooted in his basic existence, held more promise than that of a merely learned man but rarely ripened into something reportable. He hinted at hidden geniuses in humble, illiterate lives, deep and opaque like Walden Pond.

Many travelers went out of their way to see me and my house, often asking for a glass of water as an excuse. I would direct them to the pond and offer them a dipper. Despite my remote location, I still experienced the annual influx of visitors, especially around April. These included not only curious onlookers but also half-witted men from the almshouse. I tried to engage them in conversations that showcased their wit, often finding them wiser than town officials and overseers.

One memorable visitor was a simple-minded pauper who admitted with touching honesty that he was "deficient in intellect." He believed the Lord cared for him just as much as anyone else, despite his condition. His sincere and humble demeanor led to some of the most profound interactions I had, highlighting that humility often leads to greater wisdom.

I also received visits from other poor souls who weren't officially recognized as such, seeking aid without any intention of helping themselves. While I welcomed visitors with good appetites, objects of charity were not my guests. Among my visitors were runaway slaves looking for safety, and I even helped one head towards the North Star.

Men with one or many ideas, each unique in their own way, came to see me. One man suggested a guest book, but my memory made that unnecessary. My visitors had various peculiarities: children and young people enjoyed the woods, while business-minded men and farmers thought only of solitude and distance. Some ministers, doctors, lawyers, and uneasy housekeepers pried into my personal space, each with their own biases and preoccupations.

Finally, there were the reformers, the most tiresome of all, who misunderstood my independence. Despite not fearing hen-harriers (since I kept no chickens), I did dread the "men-harriers."

Beyond these challenging visitors, I also had more uplifting guests: children berry-picking, railroad workers, fishermen, hunters, poets, and philosophers. These honest pilgrims, seeking freedom in the woods, were always welcomed with open arms.

The Bean-Field

My beans, spread over seven miles of rows, were eager for attention. The first planted had grown substantially, and I couldn't delay the work. This Herculean task, though seemingly pointless, became something I loved. The beans connected me to the earth, giving me strength like Antaeus. My curious summer labor turned this land of cinquefoil, blackberries, and johnswort into a bean field. I wondered what I would learn from my beans as I tended them diligently. The dews, rains, and inherent soil fertility supported my efforts against worms, cool days, and woodchucks, which devastated a quarter acre. Yet, soon, the beans would grow too tough for such pests.

At four, I moved from Boston to my native town, passing through these woods and fields to the pond—one of my earliest memories. Today, my flute echoes over the same water. The pines, older than me, stand firm, with fallen ones fueling my supper, as new growth rises for future generations. The persistent johnswort remains, while my beans, corn, and potatoes mark my presence here.

I cultivated two and a half acres of upland, planting without manure since the land was cleared only fifteen years ago. Digging up arrowheads revealed an ancient civilization had farmed here, depleting the soil. Early mornings, before any woodchuck or squirrel stirred and while dew still covered the ground—contrary to farmers' advice—I began my work. Barefoot in the dewy sand, I leveled weeds and dusted their heads.

As the sun blazed, I hoed beans, pacing between the green rows. One end of the patch offered shade under shrub oaks, the other, a blackberry field maturing with each bout. This daily task—removing weeds, nurturing the beans—transformed the soil's expression from grass to beans. Working without livestock or modern implements, my progress was slow, fostering a deep connection with my beans.

To westbound travelers, I was a laborious native, contrasted with their relaxed journeys. My cultivated field, visible from the road, drew their comments about my late planting and lack of manure. Their advice and curiosity highlighted my solitary, unconventional farming method. This field, unlike any in Mr. Coleman's report, bridged wild and cultivated lands, representing a semi-civilized state. The beans, edging back to their wild origins, were cheered on by my hoe, playing the Ranz des Vaches for them.

Near atop a birch, the brown-thrasher sings all morning, glad of your company and ready to move if you weren't there. As you plant seeds, he chirps, "Drop it, drop it—cover it up, cover it up—pull it up, pull it up." Fortunately for you, this was not corn, so it remained safe from his meddling. His lively song, often more valued than ash or plaster, was a preferred top dressing for the soil.

Hoeing the soil revealed relics of bygone civilizations, mingling with natural stones, some fire-affected, others sunburned, alongside recent pottery and glass. The sound of my hoe against the stones echoed through the woods, accompanying my labor, creating an instant and boundless harvest. It felt less like I was hoeing beans and more like uncovering history; the contrast to friends attending city oratorios was striking. Overhead, the night-hawk swooped with a noise resembling the heavens tearing, laying eggs unnoticed on bare hilltops, symbolizing nature's interconnectedness. Alternatively, I watched hen-hawks or wild pigeons, their graceful flight reflecting my thoughts, and unearthed a spotted salamander, a contemporary trace of ancient Egypt.

During local celebrations, the town's cannon fire echoed faintly in my bean field. The distant booms felt like bursting puffballs, sometimes giving a vague sense of a pending eruption. Occasionally, a wind would bring news of the 'trainers,' likened to a hum of swarming bees. Once the silence resumed, the townsfolk's efforts to hive these bees implied a return to tranquil pursuits.

These sounds filled me with pride and trust in the safe guardianship of Massachusetts's liberties, invigorating me to continue my work with confidence. When multiple bands played, it seemed as if the whole village breathed in unison, sometimes delivering a noble strain that stirred a sense of warrior chivalry within me, making trivial matters seem unworthy of concern.

Working with beans led to a unique experience; I cultivated them from planting to harvest and sale. Hoeing from dawn until noon, I developed an intimate knowledge of various weeds, ruthlessly uprooting them with my hoe. Each day was a battle against these plant adversaries, with the beans depending on my efforts to clear their foes. Any towering weed standing above its comrades fell before my hoe, ensuring the beans thrived.

During those summer days, while some contemporaries focused on fine arts in Boston or Rome, contemplation in India, or trade in London or New York, I, along with other New England farmers, dedicated my time to farming. Not because I needed beans to eat, being more inclined towards rice like a Pythagorean, but partly for the sake of expression and parables. Although I didn't use manure or hoe the beans extensively, I hoed them effectively enough, appreciating the value of engaging in the soil as Evelyn notes.

This field, having rested and renewed itself, seemed revived with "vital spirits" from the air, as Sir Kenelm Digby suggests. I harvested twelve bushels of beans.

However, to be specific, as Mr. Coleman primarily reported costly experiments of gentleman farmers, my expenses were:

- Hoe: $0.54
- Ploughing, harrowing, and furrowing: $7.50
- Beans for seed: $3.12½
- Potatoes for seed: $1.33
- Peas for seed: $0.40
- Turnip seed: $0.06
- White line for crow fence: $0.02
- Horse cultivator and boy for three hours: $1.00
- Horse and cart to transport crop: $0.75

Total expenses: $14.72½

My earnings were:

- Nine bushels and twelve quarts of beans sold: $16.94
- Five bushels of large potatoes: $2.50
- Nine bushels of small potatoes: $2.25
- Grass: $1.00
- Stalks: $0.75

Total income: $23.44

Resulting in a profit of $8.71½.

Plant small white bush beans around June 1st in rows three feet by eighteen inches apart, using fresh, pure seeds. Watch for worms and replant if needed. Protect young plants from woodchucks, which can damage tender leaves and tendrils. Harvest early to avoid frost damage and ensure a good crop.

Reflecting on my experience, I decided to focus less on planting beans and corn and more on cultivating virtues like sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith, and innocence. Despite my efforts, these seeds of virtue failed to grow, much like worm-eaten or lifeless seeds. People often follow traditional planting methods without trying new approaches, even as older generations continue their routines.

Why not explore new adventures and focus less on conventional crops like grains, potatoes, and grass? Our efforts should also go toward nurturing qualities like truth and justice. Meeting people who embody these virtues would nourish our spirit more than mere agricultural produce. Ambassadors should collect and distribute seeds of these virtues.

Agriculture was once considered sacred, but today it is pursued hastily for profit, degrading the practice and the farmer’s life. Ancient Romans revered the earth as both a mother and a deity, seeing farming as a pious pursuit. We should remember that the sun shines equally on cultivated fields and wild landscapes, and we should embrace this generous view.

Our harvests should not just be measured in crops but in the overall harmony of our efforts with nature. The true farmer will work without anxiety, enjoying the abundance of nature, including weeds that feed birds. Let us relinquish the fixation on farm produce and appreciate the broader blessings of the earth.

The Village

After hoeing or reading and writing in the forenoon, I usually bathed in the pond, swimming across a cove and washing off the dust of labor. This left me free for the afternoon. Every couple of days, I strolled to the village to catch up on the ever-present gossip, which I found as refreshing as the sounds of nature. In the village, I observed men and boys much like I would birds and squirrels in the woods. Instead of wind in the trees, I heard carts rattle. 

One direction from my house had a colony of muskrats, while under the elms and buttonwoods in another lay the busy village. The village was a hub of news, supported by groceries and items like a bell, a big gun, and a fire-engine to service it. The houses were arranged to maximize human interaction, much like a gauntlet for travelers, with businesses advertising to catch different aspects of their interest.

I often avoided these distractions by either moving quickly or focusing my thoughts elsewhere, similar to Orpheus using music to ignore the Sirens. Sometimes I would bolt suddenly to avoid notice, or take shortcuts through obstacles. I occasionally visited homes for news and departed through back paths to return to the woods.

At night, launching into dark and stormy weather from the village with supplies, I navigated the woods by familiar markers, feeling my way through paths and trees. Once, when guiding visitors on a dark night, they wandered for hours near their homes because they couldn’t see the path.

Getting lost—whether in the village or woods—highlighted the vastness and mystery of nature. We rely on familiar landmarks, unconsciously steering by them. Only when lost do we realize our true bearings.

One summer afternoon, fetching a shoe from the cobbler, I was jailed for not paying taxes to a state that traded in human lives. Released the next day, I retrieved my shoe and returned home uneventfully. Despite leaving my home unguarded, it was respected more than if protected by soldiers. Visitors warmed themselves by my fire, read my books, and inspected my sparse belongings. While I lost one small book, I believed my simple lifestyle, if universal, would eliminate theft and robbery, occurring only where there’s inequality.

"Nor wars did men molest, When only beechen bowls were in request."

You who govern public affairs should cultivate virtue to inspire the people rather than rely on punishments. Virtue in leadership leads the people, much like grass bends under the wind.

The Ponds

Sometimes, needing a break from society and gossip, I wandered west, beyond my usual haunts, to more secluded areas. I’d eat huckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill, storing enough for several days. True huckleberry flavor is lost in the market; only the picker knows it. Huckleberries haven’t been seen in Boston since they grew on its original hills. The essence of the fruit is lost during transport, transforming them into mere fodder.

After finishing my day’s work, I occasionally joined a silent fishing companion. One older man, adept in woodcraft, loved to sit at my house to arrange his fishing lines. We’d sometimes sit in the boat together, he humming a psalm, our silent company harmonious. Alone, I’d strike my paddle on the boat, filling the woods with echoes, stirring them like a menagerie keeper rouses beasts.

Warm evenings found me playing the flute in the boat, attracting perch and watching the moon’s reflection on the forest-strewn bottom. I used to visit this pond on dark summer nights, fishing for pouts with worms, ending the night by tossing burning brands into the water like fireworks. Now, I had made my home by the shore.

Sometimes, after a late visit to a village, I’d fish by moonlight, serenaded by owls and foxes, hearing mysterious birds. These were memorable experiences, anchored deep and surrounded by fish, feeling vibrations on the line from life below. Pulling up a horned pout in the darkness, my dreams interrupted, linked me back to nature. It felt as if I might next cast my line upward to catch another fish in a different element, much as I caught two with one hook.

The scenery of Walden is modest yet beautiful, lacking grandeur unless one has frequented or lived by its shore. Despite its humble scale, this pond is notable for its depth and purity. It is a clear, deep green well, half a mile long and nearly two miles in circumference, covering about sixty-one and a half acres. Surrounded by pine and oak woods, it has no visible inlet or outlet except for the clouds and evaporation. The hills rise abruptly from the water, reaching forty to eighty feet high, and on the southeast and east, they reach about one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet within a quarter to a third of a mile. These hills are completely wooded.

Concord’s waters display at least two colors: one from a distance influenced by the sky and another up close. In summer, they appear blue when viewed from afar, becoming dark slate during storms. Although the sea can change from blue to green without atmospheric changes, Walden can appear blue or green even from the same viewpoint. The pond reflects sky colors from a hilltop but appears yellowish where it meets the shore, transitioning to light green and then dark green in deeper waters. Some say this green hue is due to verdure reflection, though it persists even against areas without vegetation.

Walden’s color intricacies also show it as green during snow-covered landscapes. Even at a little distance under mixed light angles, it appears as a darker blue than the sky, yet up close, its water held to the light is colorless, akin to air. Larger bodies of water, much like a large plate of glass, can take on a green tint, but this phenomenon has not been fully tested with Walden’s waters.

Transparent enough that its bottom is visible at twenty-five to thirty feet, the pond allows for clear observation of perch and shiners below the surface. In winter, after losing an axe into a hole in the ice, a curious observer saw it standing upright, gently swaying beneath the water. Retrieving it involved cutting another hole over it, using a birch stick and slip-noose, carefully drawing the axe out.

The shore consists of smooth, rounded white stones, resembling paving stones, with a few short sandy beaches. It is steep, and a single leap often lands you in deep water. Its remarkable transparency makes its bottom visible as it slopes away. Some believe it is bottomless. The shore is never muddy, and there are hardly any noticeable plants apart from a few small heart-leaves and potamogetons. The stones extend a rod or two into the water, transitioning to pure sand except in the deepest parts, where sediment from decayed leaves settles. A bright green weed is occasionally brought up on anchors even in midwinter.

White Pond, about two and a half miles west, is similar, but few other ponds in the area match its purity. Successive generations have admired and explored this pond, yet its water remains as green and clear as ever. Possibly existing since ancient times, it has always been a crystal-clear lake, earning a heavenly reputation. Its historical significance and continued allure are likened to a gem in Concord's crown.

An ancient narrow path circles the pond, likely worn by early inhabitants, still visible after a light snowfall. The pond’s level fluctuates, typically higher in winter and lower in summer, independent of general weather patterns. It has varied by up to six or seven feet over the years. This fluctuation kills the encroaching shrubs and trees on its edge, clearing the shore and asserting its rightful boundary. Pitch pines, alders, and other trees around the pond struggle to maintain themselves under these changing conditions.

Traditions suggest the pond was once the site of an Indian pow-wow, leading to its creation and the placement of the stones on the shore. Though stories vary, geological observations support that the surrounding hills contain similar stones.

Walden Pond’s water is cold and pure, particularly in winter, making it among the best in town. Its depth prevents it from warming significantly in summer. The water remains fresh for days when stored properly, and campers can keep it cool easily without ice.

Walden’s fish population includes pickerel, perch, pouts, shiners, and a few eels. Though not abundant, the fish are notably firm and clean due to the pure water. The pond also hosts clean frogs, tortoises, muskrats, minks, occasional mud-turtles, ducks, geese, swallows, peetweets, and sometimes a fishhawk. The presence of these animals enhances the natural beauty and ecosystem of the pond.

Near the sandy eastern shore of the pond, in calm weather, you can spot circular heaps of small stones, half a dozen feet in diameter and a foot high, emerging from the surrounding bare sand. Initially, you might think these were formed by the Indians on the ice, sinking as it melted, but their regularity and freshness suggest otherwise. Without suckers or lampreys here, they might be the nests of the chivin, adding an intriguing mystery to the pond’s bottom.

The shore's irregularity keeps it interesting. The western shore with deep bays, the bolder northern shore, and the beautifully scalloped southern shore, with capes suggesting unexplored coves, come to mind. Forests look their best when viewed from the center of a small lake surrounded by hills. The water reflects the forest and creates a pleasing boundary. Unlike areas cleared by axes or cultivated fields, the water side lets trees expand fully, forming a natural selvage. Man’s presence is minimal, and the water laps the shore as it has for centuries.

A lake is a landscape’s most beautiful feature, often described as "earth's eye," reflecting the viewer's depth. Trees by the shore resemble eyelashes, and the hills and cliffs serve as its brows. On a calm September afternoon, the lake’s surface can resemble glass, looking like a fine thread against distant pine woods. The scene is so serene that swallows sometimes dive below the perceived surface, deceived by its glassiness. As you gaze, you might need to shield your eyes from the dual suns' reflections. The water mirrors like glass, only disturbed by skater insects creating sparkles or fish leaping and causing ripples. The water is likened to molten glass, with motes enhancing its beauty.

In autumn, Walden Pond becomes a perfect forest mirror, needing no fence, untainted by nations coming and going. Its reflective surface is untouchable by storms or dust, continually renewed by nature. Impurities presented to it sink, cleansed by the sun's hazy brush.

The shore, breeze-ruffled water, and surrounding air create a life and motion unique to the lake, intermediate between land and sky. You can see the breeze's streaks of light across the water, anticipating a future where we might look down on air similarly.

By late October, skaters and water-bugs vanish as frosts set in. One November afternoon, the pond, still from days of rain, reflected the somber colors of the hills. My boat’s gentle undulations extended far, creating a ribbed appearance on the reflections. Upon closer inspection, faint glimmers revealed myriads of small perch dimpling the surface, swimming like birds, their tails causing splashes when alarmed. As winter approached, these fish used the remaining warm days before ice covered their home. The wind, mist, and waves heightened the sense of movement, with perch leaping high above the surface. Even in December, dimples caused by perch, misinterpreted as rain, highlighted the pond’s unchanging tranquility amidst the anticipation of winter.

An old man who visited this pond sixty years ago, when surrounded by dense forests, recalls seeing it teeming with ducks and other birds, and eagles circling above. He fished using a cumbersome log canoe made of two white-pine logs, pinned together and found on the shore; it lasted many years before sinking. The origins of the canoe were unknown; it seemed to belong to the pond. He fashioned an anchor cable from hickory bark strips. A potter living by the pond before the Revolution once told him of an iron chest at the bottom that sometimes floated ashore but retreated to deeper water when approached. I was intrigued by the log canoe, reminiscent of a more graceful Indian one likely made from a tree by the bank. Peering into the depths, I used to see large trunks, either blown over or left on ice, but now mostly gone.

When I first paddled on Walden, it was encircled by thick pine and oak woods. In some coves, grapevines formed bowers under which boats could pass. The steep hills made the pond resemble an amphitheater. I spent many hours drifting in my boat, lying back, daydreaming until I touched the shore. Idleness then was the most enriching pursuit. I cherished those sunny hours over more conventional work. However, woodchoppers have since devastated the area, making it unrecognizable for years, silencing the birds and my Muse.

Now, with the log canoe and surrounding woods gone, villagers plan to pipe its once-sacred water to wash dishes. The disruptive train, "the Iron Horse," has muddied the Boiling Spring and cleared the woods on Walden’s shore. This modern threat begs for a champion to defend it.

Despite these changes, Walden remains pure and unchanged, unlike many who try to emulate it. The woodchoppers, Irish settlers, railroad, and ice-men have all impacted it; yet, it remains the same pond my youthful eyes knew. Its perennial youth and reflection evoke admiration, showing no permanent wrinkles after years of ripples. Observing it, I feel the same joy and connection to its creator. It feels as if Walden greets me anew, retaining its essence and beauty.

I am its stony shore, the breeze passing over, holding its water and sand in my hand, with its deepest secrets in my thoughts. Though the train passengers often overlook it, those who see it regularly gain a sense of serenity and purity. Some suggest it be called "God’s Drop."

Walden has no visible inlets or outlets but is indirectly linked to Flint’s Pond and directly to Concord River by chains of ponds. If its isolation has granted it such remarkable purity, mixing it with Flint’s comparatively impure waters or the ocean would be lamentable.

Flint’s Pond, also known as Sandy Pond in Lincoln, is our largest lake, covering 197 acres and rich in fish, though it's shallow and not very pure. I often walked through the woods to reach it for the fresh wind and waves, which reminded me of mariners' lives. In the fall, I gathered chestnuts there on windy days, and once discovered the remnants of an old boat along the shore. The wreck was evocative, blending into the pond’s rushes. The sandy bottom at the north end was firm, with ripples and rushes growing in orderly lines, resembling waves. I found peculiar grass or root balls, perfectly spherical and appearing seasonally, which seem more worn down by waves than formed by them.

The name "Flint’s Pond" reflects poor naming traditions. The farmer who named it valued money over nature, seeing wildlife as trespassers and exploiting the land. He didn't appreciate the pond or its natural beauty, preferring to turn it into farmland. The pond deserves a name reflecting its natural inhabitants or someone with a meaningful connection to it. The farmer only saw it in terms of monetary value, with no respect for its intrinsic worth. Unlike this farmer, I value the poor farmers who find true wealth in nature's beauty, not in monetary gains. If we name our landscapes after people, they should be named after the noblest among us, just as the Icarian Sea recalls brave endeavors.

Goose Pond, small in size, lies on my way to Flint’s. Fair-Haven, a 70-acre expansion of Concord River, is a mile southwest, and White Pond, around 40 acres, is a mile and a half further. These, along with Concord River, form my lake country and water resources, continuously grinding the work I bring them.

Walden, though now marred by woodcutters, the railroad, and my own actions, was once the most beautiful lake. White Pond, despite its common name, is perhaps the most attractive now. Its remarkable purity and sands earn it the title. It mirrors Walden in many ways—stony shores and similarly colored waters. Especially in hot summer weather, the shallow bays reflect a bluish-green hue. Years ago, I used to collect sand from there for making sandpaper and have visited it ever since. Some consider naming it Virid Lake or Yellow-Pine Lake. About fifteen years ago, a yellow-pine tree was seen protruding from its deep waters, suggesting the pond had lowered over time. Even in 1792, local descriptions noted a tree in its center, standing with roots 50 feet below the surface. In 1849, I spoke to a man who removed this tree, describing it as surprisingly inverted with the base buried in the sandy bottom. Though hoped to be a saw-log, it was too rotten, eventually used as fuel.

White Pond remains largely undisturbed by boats, offering little for fishermen. Instead of white lilies and sweet flags, blue flag iris grows in its clear waters, attracting hummingbirds in June. The blue blades and flowers harmonize with the pond’s glaucous color.

Both White Pond and Walden are like great earthbound crystals. If solid and small, they’d be prized by emperors, but as liquid and ample, they’re overlooked in our pursuit of material gems. They are too pure to value, free of muck, and far more beautiful and transparent than our lives. Nature, in its splendor, remains unappreciated by people, flourishing alone, far from human settlements. While we chase ideals of heaven, we often overlook the grace and beauty of earth.

Baker Farm

Sometimes I wandered to pine groves, standing like temples or ships at sea, with wavy branches and soft, green, shady light—so enchanting that even Druids would have abandoned their oaks to worship there. I also visited the cedar woods near Flint’s Pond, where blue-berried trees spiral skyward and creeping juniper carpets the ground. In swamps, usnea lichen hangs from white-spruce trees, toadstools scatter like swamp gods' tables, and fungi decorate stumps like butterflies or shells. Swamp-pink and dogwood flourish, red alder berries glow like impish eyes, and waxwork twists woods in its grip, while wild-holly berries mesmerize with their beauty.

Instead of visiting scholars, I often visited rare, individual trees in pastures, woods, swamps, or on hilltops. The black-birch, yellow birch with its fragrant, golden bark, and the neat, lichen-painted beech were among my favorites, though there are few sizable beech groves left. Splitting beech wood reveals sparkling silver grain. I also admired the basswood, hornbeam, and the rare Celtis occidentalis. Tall pine masts and perfect hemlocks stood like pagodas in the forest. These were my shrines, visited in both summer and winter.

Once, I stood at the very end of a rainbow’s arch, which tinted the grass and leaves around me, dazzling like colored crystal. It felt like living in a lake of rainbow light. Walking along the railroad causeway, I marveled at the halo of light around my shadow, imagining myself one of the elect. A visitor remarked that this halo appeared only around locals’ shadows, not Irishmen’s. Benvenuto Cellini mentioned a similar phenomenon in his memoirs, where a light haloed his shadow after a vision in the castle of St. Angelo, especially when the grass was dewy. This constant but rarely noticed phenomenon could easily fuel superstitious beliefs in an excitable mind like Cellini’s. He showed it to few, but indeed, those aware of being observed are truly distinguished.

One afternoon, I went fishing at Fair-Haven to supplement my meager vegetable diet. My path took me through Pleasant Meadow, part of the Baker Farm, a place immortalized by a poet:

"Thy entry is a pleasant field,
With mossy fruit trees and a ruddy brook,
Gliding musquash and darting trout."

Before moving to Walden, I had considered living there. I "borrowed" some apples, leaped over the brook, and startled the muskrats and trout. It was one of those timeless afternoons, full of potential events, though already half-spent when I began. A shower forced me to shelter under a pine tree for half an hour, and, as I stood waist-deep in water casting my line, thunder began to rumble, driving me to the nearest deserted hut.

This abandoned cabin now housed John Field, an Irishman, his wife, and their children. We took refuge under the least leaky part of the roof. John, a hard-working yet unfortunate man, shared his struggles of working for a neighboring farmer and earning little for his efforts. His broad-faced son assisted him cheerfully, unaware of the poor bargain his father had made. 

I offered my advice, explaining how I lived simply in a small, clean house, needing little work or money. I didn’t use tea, coffee, butter, milk, or fresh meat, so I didn't have to labor hard to afford them. John sighed at this, while his wife looked on, arms akimbo, wondering if they had the resources to begin such a simple life.

"Do you ever fish?" I asked. "Yes, sometimes I catch perch," John replied. His wife encouraged him to go fishing now, but he hesitated.

The rain ended, and a rainbow promised a pleasant evening as I left. I asked for water and observed their makeshift well, reflecting on their life. Drinking the offered water, I appreciated their hospitality despite their humble circumstances.

As I returned to the pond, my quest for pickerel seemed trivial. But as I ran towards the sunset with the rainbow behind me and faint sounds in the air, my spirit urged me to explore and appreciate nature’s gifts daily, free of care. Enjoy the land without owning it. Men’s lack of enterprise traps them in lives of buying and selling.

"O Baker Farm, simple and innocent,
Thy plain guise hides profound tranquility.
Come all, lovers and haters alike,
And find solace beneath thy trees."

So, I embraced the wild, heeding not the rumbling thunder, but finding joy in the untamed beauty around me.

Men often return home tamely from nearby fields or streets, their lives stifled by monotony, their shadows extending farther than their daily steps. We should return home each day from distant adventures, perils, and discoveries, enriched with new experiences and character.

Before reaching the pond, a fresh impulse brought out John Field, who had decided to quit "bogging" by sunset. Sadly, he disturbed only a couple of fish while I caught a fair string, attributing it to luck. Yet, when we swapped seats in the boat, our luck changed too. Poor John Field! I hope he improves from this if he reads it, instead of relying on outdated methods in this new land—using shiners to catch perch. Though sometimes effective, with all his opportunities, he remains poor, burdened by inherited poverty and not destined to rise until his "bog-trotting" feet gain wings.

Higher Laws

As I returned home through the dark woods with my string of fish and trailing pole, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck crossing my path, igniting a strange, savage thrill and a strong temptation to devour him raw—not out of hunger, but for the wildness he represented. During my time at the pond, I sometimes roamed the woods like a starved hound, seeking venison to devour. The wildest scenes had become oddly familiar. I felt an instinct toward both a higher, spiritual life and a primitive, savage one, revering them both. I love the wild as much as the good. Fishing, with its wildness and adventure, still appeals to me. It connects me with life in a way that spending the day like animals do might. Hunting and fishing in my youth gave me a deep connection with Nature, leading to a familiarity with scenery otherwise unknown at that age. Those who spend their lives in nature—fishermen, hunters, woodchoppers—are often better observers of it than philosophers or poets approaching with expectations. Nature reveals herself to them without fear. A traveler learns second-hand and is poor authority; true human experience comes from practical or instinctive knowledge.

It's a mistake to think the Yankee lacks amusements due to fewer public holidays and games compared to England. The primitive, solitary amusements like hunting and fishing have yet to give way to more communal activities. Almost every New England boy in my time hunted and fished freely, unlike the restricted preserves of English noblemen. However, a change is occurring not from increased humanity but from a scarcity of game. The hunter, perhaps, is the greatest friend of the animals hunted.

At the pond, I sometimes wished for fish to diversify my meals and fished out of necessity, like the first fishers. Humanity concerns were more philosophical than felt; I did not pity the fish or worms—this was habit. Regarding fowling, I had long sold my gun and no longer felt the need to study birds with it, as closer attention to bird habits proved more valuable. Despite objections on humane grounds, I doubt if equally valuable sports will replace hunting. When asked by friends if their boys should hunt, I say yes, considering hunting a vital part of my education; make them hunters, and perhaps, one day, mighty hunters, not satisfied with the game either in this or any wilderness. Thus, I share Chaucer’s nun’s view:

“yave not of the text a pulled hen
That saith that hunters ben not holy men.”

There is a stage in individual and societal development when hunters are revered, as noted by the Algonquins. We should pity the boy who never fired a gun, as it suggests a neglected aspect of his education. This was my hope for youths obsessed with hunting, trusting they would eventually outgrow it. A humane person, beyond boyhood, does not kill creatures without necessity. The hare's cry in distress is like a child's. My sympathies do not always align with traditional philanthropic distinctions.

Young men often first enter the forest as hunters and fishers. If they have a propensity for a higher life, they later become poets or naturalists, abandoning their guns and poles. Many men remain young in this regard. In some places, a hunting parson is common, yet such a figure is far from being the Good Shepherd. I noted that the only activity, aside from manual labor, that kept townspeople at Walden Pond for more than half a day was fishing. They often measured success by the quantity of fish caught, rather than appreciating the pond. Although it might take numerous visits for the purpose of fishing to transform, this clarifying process is ongoing. Even dignitaries who fished there as boys no longer do so, though they expect to reach heaven, forgetting the pond. Legislation mainly focuses on regulating fishing, not appreciating the deeper value of nature.

I discovered that fishing diminishes my self-respect. Despite my skill and instinct, I always feel it would have been better not to fish. Each year I drift further from being a fisherman, embracing a cleaner, more humane lifestyle. Living simply, without animal foods, aligns with my imagination and higher faculties. Insects in their perfect state barely eat, showing that gross feeding belongs to undeveloped stages. A diet that respects this principle nourishes both body and imagination.

Preparing simple, clean meals that do not offend the imagination, eating fruits temperately, and avoiding rich cookery align with higher values and true civilization. The reluctance to eat animal food is instinctual and not based on adverse effects. It reflects a desire for a more innocent diet. Humanity’s gradual improvement will include ceasing to eat animals, just as civilizations moved away from cannibalism.

Following one's inner genius, no matter how faint, leads to a life in conformity with higher principles. True success evokes joy and a connection with nature. The greatest values in life are often intangible, like capturing a moment of beauty.

Despite not being overly sensitive, I prefer a simple diet, drinking water like enjoying the natural sky. Sobriety is essential, and water is the wisest drink. Even seemingly minor indulgences, like tea and coffee, lower my state. Prefer the intoxication of pure air. Intense labor demands coarser food and drink, which I now accept more than before. With age, I’ve become less scrupulous, less devout at meals, and more indifferent. High ideals are often youthful pursuits, but the essence remains. True faith allows freedom in diet even during difficult times, reflecting a Vedant principle.

Who hasn’t derived deep satisfaction from food, beyond mere hunger? I’ve been thrilled by the idea that taste can inspire the mind, that a hillside berry can fuel genius. Thseng-tseu said, “The soul not being mistress of herself, one looks and does not see; listens and does not hear; eats and does not know the taste of food.” Understanding the true savor of food prevents gluttony; failing to do so ensures it. It's not the food itself, but the appetite with which it is consumed that defines us. Quality and quantity are secondary to how devoted we are to sensual pleasures. Whether indulging in rustic or exotic delicacies, it is all the same in essence. The question is how we, or anyone, can live a life so consumed by eating and drinking.

Life is inherently moral, with no moment’s truce between virtue and vice. Goodness is the only unfailing investment. The music of the world’s harmony insists on this point. Though youth may grow indifferent, the laws of the universe support the most sensitive. Every breeze carries a reproof, unfortunate is he who does not hear it. Every action reveals a moral truth, turning even noise into a poignant critique of our lives.

We sense an animal within us, awakening as our higher nature sleeps. This reptile is inherently sensual and may never be fully expelled, much like the worms inhabiting us. While we might distance ourselves from it, we can't change its nature. There’s a distinct animal health separate from spiritual health. Mencius stated, “The difference between men and beasts is slight, and superior men preserve it carefully.” What life would purity bring? If I knew a sage who could teach me purity, I’d seek him immediately. Command over passions and senses, and good acts are indispensable in approaching God. The spirit can transform even the grossest sensuality into purity. The energy that weakens us when loose invigorates us when contained. Chastity gives rise to Genius, Heroism, and Holiness. When purity channels from us to God, it inspires; impurity, however, casts us down. Blessed is he who feels the animal dying within him and the divine taking hold. We are, to an extent, akin to satyrs, our divine nature mingling with beasts. Our very existence can be a disgrace.

“How happy’s he who hath due place assigned
To his beasts and disafforested his mind!
* * * * *
Can use this horse, goat, wolf, and ev’ry beast,
And is not ass himself to all the rest!
Else man not only is the herd of swine,
But he’s those devils too which did incline
Them to a headlong rage, and made them worse.”

All sensuality is one, small variations notwithstanding; all purity is one. A person's actions, whether eating, drinking, or otherwise, demonstrate their sensuality. A sensual person cannot act with purity. The reptile's nature reveals itself through every outlet. To be chaste, one must be temperate. What is chastity? We often speak of it without truly understanding it. Activity brings wisdom and purity; sloth brings ignorance and sensuality. Sensuality manifests as mental sluggishness in the student. An unclean person is often lazy. Overcoming our nature is difficult but necessary. Christian identity means little without surpassing pagan purity and devotion.

I hesitate to speak on this not because of the topic but because discussing it may reveal my impurity. We easily discuss one form of sensuality and remain silent on another. We are so degraded that we cannot discuss basic human functions simply. In earlier times, all aspects of life were openly and respectfully regulated by law. Elevating life's meaner aspects was considered necessary.

Everyone builds a temple, their body, reflecting the god they worship. Nobility refines, while meanness and sensuality degrade a person's features. John Farmer spent an evening reflecting on his labor. He heard flute music, harmonizing with his thoughts, and considered how little his work truly concerned him. The music lifted him beyond the mundane, prompting a reflection: Why live a mean life when a glorious one is possible? He mused on how to transcend his current condition, concluding that practicing new austerity and showing greater respect for himself might be the way.

Brute Neighbors

Sometimes I had a companion for fishing, making catching dinner as social as eating it.

Hermit. I wonder what the world is doing now. I haven't heard a sound in three hours—not even a locust. The pigeons are all asleep. Was that a farmer’s noon horn? The workers are coming in for boiled salt beef, cider, and Indian bread. Why do people stress so much? If you don’t eat, you need not work. I wonder how much they’ve harvested. Who would live where you can't think for the barking of dogs? And all the housekeeping—keeping everything clean on such a bright day! Better not keep a house. Maybe a hollow tree would do for morning calls and dinner parties. Only a woodpecker tapping. They swarm; it’s too warm in the sun. I have spring water and a loaf of brown bread. Hark! I hear rustling leaves. Is it a hungry village hound or the lost pig whose tracks I saw? My plants tremble. Eh, Mr. Poet, is that you? How do you like the world today?

Poet. See those clouds; how they hang! That’s the best thing I’ve seen today. There’s nothing like it in old paintings or foreign lands—maybe off Spain's coast. That’s a true Mediterranean sky. I thought, as I need to make a living and haven't eaten today, I might go fishing. That’s the true industry for poets, the only trade I know. Come, let’s go.

Hermit. I can’t resist. My brown bread will soon be gone. I’ll join you soon, but I’m finishing a serious meditation. Leave me for a bit. You dig the bait meanwhile. Angle-worms are rare here; the soil isn’t fertile. Digging for bait is almost as fun as fishing when one’s appetite isn’t too keen. Try over among the ground-nuts, where the johnswort waves. You should find a worm every three sods if you look among the grass roots. Go farther if you like; bait increases almost as the square of the distance.

Hermit alone. Where was I? Shall I go to heaven or fishing? If I end this meditation soon, will another sweet occasion come? I was nearly resolved into things' essence. I fear my thoughts won’t return. If it helped, I’d whistle for them. When they offer, should we delay thinking? My thoughts left no track; I can’t find the path. What was I thinking? It was hazy. Maybe three sentences of Confucius will help. Was it despondence or budding ecstasy? Note: There’s only ever one opportunity of a kind.

Poet. Hermit, is it too soon? I found thirteen whole ones, plus some imperfect or small ones—good for smaller fish. Village worms are too large; a shiner might eat one without touching the hook.

Hermit. Well, then, let’s go. Shall we head to the Concord? There’s good sport if the water isn’t too high.

Why do these specific objects we see constitute a world? Why are these particular animals our neighbors, as if only a mouse could occupy this niche? Perhaps Pilpay & Co. have utilized animals best, as they all metaphorically bear a portion of our thoughts.

The mice in my house were not the common kind introduced to the country but a wild native species not found in the village. I sent one to a noted naturalist, and he found it fascinating. During construction, one nested under the house and would come out at lunchtime to pick up crumbs at my feet. Likely never having seen a human, it soon became so familiar that it would run over my shoes and climb my clothes. It could climb the room's walls with agile, squirrel-like movements. One day, as I leaned on the bench, it climbed my clothes and played around my dinner paper. When I held out a piece of cheese, it nibbled it from my hand, cleaned its face and paws, and then walked away.

A phœbe built a nest in my shed, and a robin nested in a pine near the house. In June, a typically shy partridge (Tetrao umbellus) led her brood past my windows, clucking like a hen. The young scatter at the mother’s signal, blending with the forest floor so well that travelers often step among them without realizing. The parent bird might perform a distractive act, rolling and spinning, making it hard to identify her. The young remain motionless, even when nearly stepped on or held in my hand, obedient to their mother’s distant cues. Perfectly developed and precocious, their serene eyes reflect a purity and wisdom beyond mere infancy, akin to the sky. These woods hold no other gem like them. Yet, ignorant hunters might shoot the parent, leaving the brood to perish. When raised by a hen, they disperse at danger and are lost because they don't hear the mother’s reclaiming call. These creatures were my hens and chickens.

Many creatures live secretly in the woods near towns, eluding even hunters. The otter, for instance, can grow to be four feet long without being seen by humans. I used to see raccoons behind my house and still heard their calls at night. After planting, I often rested in the shade near a spring, half a mile from my field, surrounded by young pitch-pines and a larger wood. There, under a white-pine, I dug a clear spring, visited daily in midsummer when the pond was warmest. Woodcocks led their brood there to hunt worms, and turtles-doves and squirrels also frequented the spot. By sitting still, woodland creatures revealed themselves one by one.

I also witnessed violent events. One day, at my wood-pile, I saw a fierce battle between a red ant and a much larger black one. The chips were littered with fighting ants, a war between red and black colonies. The ants fought relentlessly, showing no desire to retreat. I observed a three-ant struggle, one red ant attacking the black one's fore-leg. I placed them under a tumbler to watch further. The red ant gnawed at the black's leg, while the black tore its foe apart. After half an hour, the black ant had decapitated the red ants and struggled to free itself from the severed heads. Eventually, it crawled away, crippled.

Such ant battles have been historically documented. Kirby and Spence noted Huber as a modern witness to these events and cited historical accounts by Æneas Sylvius and Olaus Magnus of similar ant wars. The battle I saw occurred during President Polk's term, five years before the Fugitive-Slave Bill.

Village dogs, usually confined to chasing a mud-turtle in a cellar, roamed the woods without their master's knowledge. Misled by nimble curs, they sniffed old fox burrows and woodchuck holes, sometimes pausing to bark at treed squirrels. Surprisingly, cats also ventured far from home, seemingly more at ease in the woods. I once met a wild cat with kittens, their fierce posturing reminiscent of their wild kin. Years earlier, a "winged cat" lived nearby, dark brownish-gray with a bushy tail and fur that formed wing-like stripes in winter. There was speculation about its hybrid nature with wild animals.

In autumn, loons (Colymbus glacialis) visited the pond to molt and bathe, filling the woods with their wild laughter. Alert sportsmen, armed with rifles and spy-glasses, emerged to hunt them. Despite their efforts, the wind often rose, rustling leaves and rippling water, masking the loons. I frequently saw loons close to shore, but they evaded capture by diving and reappearing far away. One loon led a clever chase as we played a game of man versus bird on the pond, his unpredictable dives and laughter taunting me.

On calm days, ducks tactfully navigated the pond, staying clear of hunters. They often circled high above before settling on distant parts of the pond, seemingly appreciating its waters much like I did.

House-Warming

In October, I went to the river meadows and gathered beautiful, fragrant grape clusters. I admired, but didn't collect, the small, waxen cranberries hanging like pearls on meadow grass, which farmers harvest with ugly rakes, damaging the land, and sell them for profit. Similarly, butchers harshly take bison tongues from the prairies. 

I also admired the barberry’s brilliant fruit but only collected a few wild apples for cooking. When chestnuts were ripe, I gathered half a bushel for winter from the now-vanished chestnut woods of Lincoln, enjoying the thrill of the rustling leaves and the scolding red squirrels and jays. Occasionally, I climbed and shook the chestnut trees and often competed with squirrels and jays for the best nuts. A large chestnut tree near my home scented the area when in bloom but mostly fed wildlife.

One day, while digging for fish-worms, I found a ground-nut, once a key food for Native Americans, now almost eradicated by cultivation. This tuber, reminiscent of a frostbitten potato, tasted better boiled than roasted and symbolized Nature’s promise to nourish humanity simply. Should wild nature return, the resilient ground-nut might regain its vital role as sustenance.

By early September, I had noticed small maples turning scarlet by the pond, each tree reflecting its unique beauty in the water. As time passed, new, more colorful scenes appeared daily around the lake.

In October, thousands of wasps settled in my lodge, seeking winter quarters. Despite sometimes deterring visitors, I felt complimented by their presence. They never seriously bothered me and disappeared into unknown crevices to escape the cold.

Before retreating for winter in November, I warmed myself on the northeast side of Walden, where the sun reflected off the pine woods and rocky shore. It was far more pleasant and healthy than artificial fires, basking in the lingering warmth that summer had left behind.

When I built my chimney, I studied masonry. Using second-hand bricks required cleaning them with a trowel, so I learned a lot about bricks and trowels. The mortar on them, fifty years old, was said to be hardening still, although such sayings often become exaggerated over time. Many Mesopotamian villages are made from high-quality second-hand bricks from Babylon; the cement on those bricks is older and likely harder. I was impressed by the durability of the steel trowel that withstood many blows.

Since my bricks had been part of a previous chimney, I selected as many fireplace bricks as I could to save labor, filling gaps with pond shore stones and making mortar with white sand from the same place. I focused most on the fireplace as the most vital part of the house. I worked so deliberately that a course of bricks a few inches above the floor served as my pillow at night, yet I didn't get a stiff neck; my stiff neck is from earlier times.

I took in a poet as a boarder for two weeks around then, which required creative room arrangements. He brought his own knife, despite me having two, and we cleaned them by thrusting them into the earth. He helped with cooking. I was pleased to see my work rising steadily and solidly, reflecting that its slow progress ensured it would last a long time. The chimney, standing independently from the ground to the sky even if the house burned down, showed its importance and durability. This was toward the end of summer, and now it was November.

The north wind had started to cool the deep pond, a process that took many weeks. Before plastering my house, I enjoyed evenings by the fire, the smoke escaping easily through the gaps between the boards. Though plastering made my home more comfortable, I preferred its airy feel with rough brown boards and exposed rafters. Every dwelling should have an element of obscurity overhead, where shadows play, more pleasing than expensive decor. I truly began inhabiting my home when I used it for warmth as well as shelter. With old firedogs to hold the wood, I found satisfaction in seeing soot form on my chimney. My small house felt larger due to its single room that served all needs—kitchen, bedroom, parlor, and more. 

Cato advised that a rustic villa should have essentials like an oil and wine cellar for challenging times. In my cellar, I stored potatoes, peas, some rice, molasses, and various grains. I sometimes dream of a grand but simple house, a single large room with bare rafters and useful features, offering shelter and all essentials in one view—kitchen, pantry, parlor, and more. In such a house, every necessary item is visible and accessible, with functional decorations and a feeling of open hospitality. Modern homes, however, often isolate guests and conceal daily life’s essentials, turning hospitality into an act of keeping distance.

Only a few guests ever stayed to share a humble meal with me; most left before the food was served, fearing it would somehow disrupt the house. The house, however, withstood many such meals.

I waited until freezing weather to plaster, bringing clean sand from across the pond by boat. My house was shingled and lathed efficiently, allowing me to transfer plaster smoothly. I recalled a story of a man who, trying to help with plastering, ended up covered in it. Plastering proved effective for warmth and aesthetics, though it revealed challenges like thirsty bricks soaking up moisture. The previous winter, I made a small amount of lime from river shells, knowing where my materials came from. I could have sourced and processed limestone nearby if needed.

The pond began to freeze in its shadiest and shallowest coves days or even weeks before the general freeze. The initial ice, being hard, dark, and transparent, is particularly interesting and perfect. This thin ice allows you to lie on it and examine the shallow bottom, where you can see the sandy furrows from creatures and cadis worms' cases made of white quartz grains.

The ice itself is most fascinating, especially the morning after freezing when it is still solid and dark, allowing a clear view of the water beneath. Bubbles, ranging from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diameter, form under the ice and reflect your face. These bubbles can number thirty or forty per square inch. Within the ice, you also find oblong vertical bubbles and spherical bubbles stacked like beads, though less obvious and numerous than those below.

Testing the ice's strength by throwing stones, I observed that air bubbles formed under the ice where stones broke through. Returning after forty-eight hours, I found these bubbles still intact despite an inch more ice forming around them. Warm weather had turned the now thicker ice opaque and whitish, reducing its strength as the bubbles expanded and lost their regular arrangement.

Curious about the bubble's position relative to the new ice, I broke out a cake containing a bubble. The bubble was included between the layers of ice, with melted ice directly beneath it forming a saucer shape, leaving a thin partition. Small bubbles in the partition often burst downward. The initial bubbles against the ice had also melted the ice beneath, causing it to crack and emit noises like little air-guns.

As winter set in with full force, the wind howled around my house, which I had just finished plastering. Night after night, geese arrived in the dark, their wings whistling, some landing in Walden, others flying low towards Fair Haven, headed for Mexico. Returning from the village late at night, I often heard the geese or ducks treading on dry leaves near my home or the faint calls of their leaders. In 1845, Walden froze over for the first time on the night of December 22nd, while other ponds and the river had frozen ten days earlier. In other years, Walden froze on December 16th (1846), around the 31st (1849), December 27th (1850), January 5th (1852), and December 31st (1853). Since November 25th, the snow had covered the ground, enclosing me in a winter scene. I kept a bright fire both inside my house and within my heart.

Outdoors, I collected dead wood from the forest, carrying it by hand or hauling dead pine trees. An old forest fence provided a good supply, as did the driftwood from the pond. During the summer, I had found a raft of pitch-pine logs left by the Irish when the railroad was built, and hauled it partly onto shore. After soaking for two years and drying for six months, the waterlogged logs burned long and hot, seemingly improved by the soaking.

Gilpin, in his account of England’s forest borderers, mentioned that encroachments by trespassers were severely punished as they frightened game and harmed the forest. I valued the preservation of the forest more than hunters or woodchoppers and grieved over any part that burned, even accidentally by me. I wished farmers felt the same awe when cutting down a forest as the Romans did when thinning a sacred grove.

Despite our advances, wood retains a high value, even more so than gold. Michaux noted decades ago that fuel wood prices in New York and Philadelphia rivaled those in Paris, which required over three hundred thousand cords annually. Wood prices in my town continue to rise, with people attending wood auctions and paying high prices for gleaning after woodchoppers. For years, men have sought the forest for fuel and materials, whether New Englanders, New Hollanders, Parisians, Celts, farmers, scholars, or savages. All, myself included, require a few sticks from the forest to stay warm and cook food.

Every man views his wood-pile with affection. I love having mine by the window, with chips reminding me of my satisfying work. I had an old axe no one claimed, and on sunny winter days, I would chop stumps from my bean-field. As predicted, they warmed me twice: once while chopping and again when burning. Advised to visit the blacksmith, I instead fitted the axe with a hickory handle. Though dull, it was true.

Finding a few pieces of fat pine was a treasure. It’s fascinating that so much hidden firewood remains underground. I often "prospected" hillside remnants of old pitch-pine woods, retrieving fat pine roots—almost indestructible, with cores still sound despite decades underground. Armed with axe and shovel, I sought out these yellow, marrowy veins like gold. Mostly, I kindled fires with dry leaves stored in my shed before snow fell. Occasionally, I used finely split green hickory. As villagers lit their fires, I too signaled my presence with chimney smoke, notifying Walden's wildlife.

Hard green wood, though rarely used, served well. Sometimes I left a good fire before a winter walk, finding it still alive hours later. My house felt occupied even in my absence, as if a cheerful housekeeper—my fire—stayed behind. Usually reliable, once I saw through the window that a spark had ignited my bed. I promptly extinguished the small blaze. My sunny, sheltered home rarely needed daytime fires in winter.

Moles nested in my cellar, nibbling potatoes and making snug beds from leftover plaster hair and brown paper. Even wild creatures crave comfort and warmth for winter survival. Friends joked that I came to the woods to freeze. While animals warm themselves in shelters, man, with fire, creates spacious, warm rooms to move comfortably, almost like summer within winter, extending daylight with windows and lamps. This step beyond instinct saves time for the fine arts. Exposed to harsh weather, I revived quickly in my home's warmth. However, our comfort depends on a fragile balance with nature, easily disrupted by harsher winters.

The next winter, a small cooking stove economized my firewood use but lacked the open fireplace’s warmth and poetry. Cooking became a mere chemic process, losing old traditions like roasting potatoes in ashes. The stove took space, scented the house, and hid the fire, making me feel the loss of a companion. Fires have faces; laborers gaze into them to clear their thoughts. No longer could I experience that meditative fire-gazing, recalling a poet’s words with new meaning. The stove, utilitarian and functional, replaced the comforting, mysterious glow of an open fire. We traded warmth and companionship for efficiency, losing old connections to our past.

Former Inhabitants and Winter Visitors

I enjoyed merry snowstorms and spent cheerful winter evenings by my fireside, with the snow whirling outside and the owl's hoot silenced. For weeks, my only encounters during walks were with those cutting wood and sledding it to the village. The elements helped me navigate through deep snow, as wind-blown oak leaves settled in my tracks, melting the snow and creating a dry path. These leaves also served as a guide at night. For company, I imagined the former inhabitants of these woods. Within living memory, the road near my house buzzed with laughter and gossip, and the surrounding woods were dotted with gardens and homes, though more enclosed by the forest back then. Pines once brushed both sides of passing carriages, and women and children often ran through the woods out of fear.

The road, now firmer and more open, once meandered through a maple swamp on a log foundation, remnants of which underlie the current highway from Stratton Farm to Brister’s Hill. East of my bean-field, Cato Ingraham, a slave of Duncan Ingraham, lived. Cato tended a walnut patch, but a younger, white speculator eventually took it. Cato's old cellar, hidden by pines and filled with smooth sumach and golden-rod, still remains.

Closer to town, Zilpha, a colored woman, lived near my field, spinning linen and filling the woods with her song. During the War of 1812, English soldiers burned her home while she was away, killing her cat, dog, and hens. She lived a hard life, often muttering to herself while cooking. Remnants of her house are still visible among the oaks.

Further along, on Brister’s Hill, lived Brister Freeman, a former slave, who planted apple trees still standing today. His epitaph in the Lincoln burying-ground calls him “Sippio Brister” or Scipio Africanus. His wife, Fenda, a fortune-teller, had a striking appearance. Down the hill, the Stratton family once lived, surrounded by an orchard now overtaken by pitch pines.

Nearer town, across from the woods, was Breed’s location, notorious for the misdeeds attributed to New-England Rum, a demon-like figure. Though the full history is untold to soften the tragedies, legends say a tavern once stood there, where travelers refreshed and exchanged news before continuing on their way.

Breed’s hut, similar in size to mine, stood until mischievous boys burned it down one Election night. I remember the event clearly; I lived on the village edge and was engrossed in Davenant’s **Gondibert** that winter. Suddenly, the fire alarm rang, and everyone, including me, rushed toward the flames, assuming it was south of the woods—maybe Baker’s barn or the Codman place. When we found the fire at Breed’s, it was too late to save anything, so we stood around, discussing great fires from history before retreating to our homes.

The next night, passing by the ruins, I found the hut’s last survivor, lying beside the smoldering cinders, reminiscing about his childhood home. He showed me the well, the well-sweep, and spoke of the family’s history. The place was now a collection of bricks and ashes, the only remainder of a once lively household.

The woods once housed other residents like Nutting, Le Grosse, Wyman the potter, and Hugh Quoil—the latter rumored to have fought at Waterloo. Quoil was a tragic figure who died soon after I arrived, and his former house, avoided by locals, was a derelict reminder of his past.

Today, these sites are marked only by depressions in the earth, overgrown with wild flora. Former wells are either dry or hidden under stones. These remnants, like deserted burrows, hint at the vibrant lives once led there, where profound discussions occurred, albeit their conclusions are now obscure and insignificant.

Despite these past failures, the lilac bushes, once planted by children, still bloom every spring. These plants, resilient and enduring, outlived the settlers, standing as silent witnesses to a lost era.

Reflecting on these abandoned hopes, I wonder why this small village failed while Concord thrived. Perhaps it lacked natural advantages, or maybe, this community just didn't utilize them. The Walden Pond and Brister’s Spring offered life, yet the settlers, a thirsty race, never harnessed these resources. Nature might try again with me as a new settler, my house the oldest in the reclaimed hamlet, free from the haunted legacy of old ruins.

In this solitude, I reimagined the past, filling the woods with memories, and found peace.

During this season, visitors rarely came. When the snow was heaviest, no wanderers appeared for weeks, yet I lived snugly, much like cattle or poultry reported to survive buried in drifts. Unlike an early settler’s family in Sutton in 1717, discovered by an Indian thanks to chimney smoke, I had no such rescuer; I didn’t need one, as I was at home. The Great Snow was a cheerful story, with farmers cutting down trees before their homes when they couldn't reach the woods.

In the deepest snows, my path from the highway was a meandering dotted line. I took the same steps daily, walking in deep tracks often filled with heaven’s blue. Despite the weather, my walks continued, sometimes eight or ten miles through deep snow to meet a beech-tree or a yellow-birch. I enjoyed watching a barred owl in broad daylight, silent in flight as he moved among the pines, feeling his way with sensitive wings.

Walking over the railroad causeway had its challenges, with harsh winds and drifts obliterating tracks quickly. Still, even in mid-winter, I found warm, springy swamps with growing grass and skunk-cabbage. Occasionally, I found a woodchopper’s tracks at my door or a farmer seeking a social chat.

The most persistent visitor was a poet, undeterred by snow or tempests, whose visits were marked by mirth and sober talk, creating vibrant discussions despite the simplicity of our surroundings. Another significant visitor, a philosopher from Connecticut, shared long winter evenings, demonstrating unwavering faith in a better future state of things, though often disregarded. He blended hospitality and intellect, engaging all manner of people in thought.

Together, we delved into philosophy, admiring the grain of thought like clear yellow pine, revising mythology, and constructing fables and ideas. Conversations with him felt like a New England Night’s Entertainment, expanding both mind and spirit.

I also spent memorable times with another friend in the village, though less frequently. Always, I awaited the Visitor who never came, reflecting on the Vishnu Purana’s suggestion of hospitality, often waiting in vain.

Winter Animals

When the ponds froze solid, they provided not only shorter routes but new perspectives of the familiar landscape. Crossing Flint’s Pond after a snowfall, I found it surprisingly vast and strange, evoking images of Baffin’s Bay. Surrounded by the Lincoln hills at the edge of a snowy plain, I felt as if I stood in a place I had never been. Fishermen, seen at a distance with their wolfish dogs, appeared as sealers or Esquimaux, or, in mist, as fabulous creatures whose size was indeterminable. Using this route to lecture in Lincoln in the evenings, I traveled across the ice, passing no homes, and encountering only a colony of muskrats at Goose Pond.

Walden, often clear of snow or with light drifts, served as my yard, where I could walk freely when other areas were buried deep in snow and villagers were confined to the streets. Skating and sliding there among snow-laden oak woods and pines, I distanced myself from the village and the occasional sound of sleigh-bells.

During winter nights and days, I heard the forlorn, melodious hoot of an owl, resonating like the frozen earth struck with a plectrum. This familiar sound often greeted me when I opened my door. One evening before the pond froze, a loud honking goose startled me. From my door, I heard a flock passing low over the house, their wings beating like a tempest. An imposing cat-owl, with an incredibly harsh voice, responded to the geese as if challenging them. The resulting cacophony was thrilling, with traces of an unusual concord.

I also heard the ice in the pond groaning, as if restless, or the ground cracking with frost, sometimes resulting in long fissures. Foxes barked demoniacally under the moonlight while searching for prey, seemingly anxious or striving to transform into more than rudimentary creatures. Occasionally, one curious fox approached my window, barked a curse, and then retreated.

Usually, the red squirrel (Sciurus Hudsonius) woke me at dawn, scampering over the roof and sides of the house as if dispatched from the woods for this purpose. During winter, I threw out half a bushel of unripe sweet-corn ears onto the snow by my door and watched the animals lured by it. Rabbits arrived at twilight for a hearty meal, while red squirrels entertained me all day with their antics. Approaching warily, squirrels used fits and starts to cover the snow crust, sometimes pausing comically, as if aware of unseen spectators. They would burst into action, scamper up a pitch-pine, chide imaginary onlookers, and finally snatch an ear of corn. One squirrel would nibble voraciously, discard half-eaten cobs, and then play with his food, only to drop it and ponder retrieving it or starting anew. Eventually, he would grab a larger ear and zigzag to the woods, like a tiger with prey, scattering cobs throughout the forest.

Jays soon appeared, their screams heard from afar. They stealthily approached to claim kernels dropped by squirrels, sometimes choking on overly large pieces before laboriously cracking them open. Unlike the industrious squirrels, the jays seemed more like opportunistic thieves.

Chickadees came in flocks to pick up crumbs, hammering them into manageable bites under their claws. Their faint notes resembled tinkling icicles or, more cheerfully, a sprightly “day day day” or a summery “phe-be” from the woods. Familiar and fearless, one chickadee even pecked at the wood I carried. Similarly, squirrels became so familiar that they would occasionally step on my shoe.

As the snow melted on the south hill-side and around my wood-pile, partridges emerged from the woods morning and evening to feed. Their sudden flight would jolt them from dry leaves, the falling snow resembling golden dust in the sunlight. Brave against winter, they sometimes rested under drifts. Partridges also ventured out at sunset to forage wild apple-trees, where cunning hunters awaited. Despite this, I was glad to see the partridges thrive—Nature’s own birds, living on buds and simple sustenance.

In dark winter mornings or short afternoons, I'd often hear hounds barking through the woods, driven by the instinct to chase. The hunting horn indicated a man was behind them. Despite the noise, no fox appeared, and the pack didn't catch its quarry. In the evening, hunters might return to town with a fox tail as a trophy. They claimed a fox would be safe if it stayed buried in the frozen earth or ran straight away. But foxes tend to circle back to familiar grounds where hunters wait. Sometimes, a fox evades hounds by leaping off walls or running through puddles, losing its scent. Packs often passed by my door, frenzied in their pursuit. One day, a man from Lexington asked about his missing hound, seeking answers but finding me instead.

An old hunter once shared his tale: with his gun in hand, he heard hounds closing in on a fox. The fox leapt over a road wall but evaded the hunter's shot. Later, the hounds followed, making the woods ring with their cries. The fox, unseen, eventually perched on a rock as the hunter aimed and killed it. The hounds arrived bewildered and silenced by the fox’s death. The hunter skinned his prey as the hounds watched. That evening, a man from Weston sought his hounds, only to learn they had been well-fed at a farm.

The hunter reminisced about Sam Nutting, famed for hunting bears and the occasional moose. Nutting had a renowned hound, Bugine, used for fox hunting. Historical entries in local records documented the trade of fox and wild-cat skins, indicating a once thriving hunting community.

At night, hounds prowled the moonlit woods, avoiding my path. Squirrels and mice contested my nut store, and many pines around my house bore the scars of mice gnawing during harsh winters. These trees, despite their wounds, thrived until another winter killed them off. The hares were regular visitors, often seen under my house or near my door, blending into the ground and startling at the slightest movement. One hare, particularly ragged, once stayed close, evoking my pity before bounding away.

Rabbits and partridges are intrinsic to the countryside, blending seamlessly with nature. They continue to thrive despite environmental changes, ensuring our forests remain lively. Even with forests cut, new growth provides cover, making these creatures more abundant. These animals are symbols of a healthy, vibrant environment.

The Pond in Winter

After a still winter night, I awoke feeling as if a question had been posed to me in my sleep—how, when, where? But Nature, with a serene face, looked in through my broad windows, offering no questions. The deep snow, dotted with young pines on the hillside where my house stands, seemed to say, "Forward!" Nature asks no questions and answers none of ours. She has long resolved her course. “O Prince, our eyes admire and transmit the wonders of this universe to the soul. The night hides part of the creation, but day reveals the grandeur extending from earth to ether.”

I begin my morning work by taking an axe and pail to fetch water. After a cold snowy night, a divining rod seems needed to find it. Each winter, the pond’s sensitive, reflective surface becomes solid, supporting heavy loads, indistinguishable from a level field under deep snow. Like the dormant marmots, the pond rests for months. Standing on this snow-covered plain, I cut through a foot of snow and ice to a window under my feet. Kneeling to drink, I peer into the quiet, lit parlor of the fishes, with its bright sandy floor and an unchanging serenity.

Early mornings, men come with fishing reels and a sparse lunch, lowering lines through the snow to catch pickerel and perch. These wild men follow their own ways and connect distant towns through their movements. They eat on dry oak leaves, wise in natural lore without consulting books. Their practices are not fully understood. Here, a man fishes with perch as bait. His pail resembles a summer pond, prompting wonder about his winter catch. He found worms in rotten logs since the ground froze. His life in nature surpasses naturalist studies; he opens logs with an axe, living by barking trees. He embodies Nature, with perch eating grub-worms, pickerel eating perch, and fishermen eating pickerel. Every niche in nature is filled.

Strolling around the pond in misty weather, I amused myself observing primitive fishing methods. A fisherman would place alder branches over narrow ice holes and attach his line to a stick to prevent it from being pulled through. Tying a dry oak leaf to the line, it signaled a bite when pulled. These alders loomed through the mist in regular intervals.

Ah, the pickerel of Walden! Seeing them on the ice or in the fisherman's well, their rare beauty always surprises me. They possess a dazzling and transcendent beauty, far removed from the common cod and haddock. Their colors, like pearls and precious stones, make them seem like living crystals of the Walden water. It's remarkable that such a magnificent fish is found here, beneath the rattling teams and sleighs on the Walden road. In any market, they would draw all eyes. With a few convulsive quivers, they surrender their watery spirits, like mortals ascending prematurely to the heavens.

In early 1846, eager to explore the depths of Walden Pond before the ice melted, I meticulously surveyed it using a compass, chain, and sounding line. Many myths about the pond’s bottomlessness existed, but I found them groundless. Remarkably, people believe such tales without ever checking. During one walk, I visited two so-called bottomless ponds locally. Some imagined Walden reaching the Earth's other side. Observers on the ice, misled by long staring and cold-induced haste, saw vast holes supposedly leading to the infernal regions. Explorers with ropes and weights went home baffled, unable to find the bottom due to their exaggerated tales.

However, Walden does have a clear bottom at a significant depth. Using a cod-line and a small weight, I easily reached the bottom, measuring the deepest point at 102 feet, now 107 feet due to water rise. This depth is notable for such a small area and is crucial for imagination. If all ponds were shallow, it would affect our perceptions. I’m grateful this pond is deep and pure, symbolizing belief in the infinite.

A factory owner doubted my findings, arguing that sand angles wouldn’t allow such depth. However, the proportions of ponds may be surprising; many emptied ponds would form unremarkable valleys, not chasms. William Gilpin noted that lakes, drained, reveal not profound chasms but modest depressions. Walden, if emptied, wouldn’t be deep compared to Loch Fyne, illustrating how perceptions of depth can mislead.

When sounding through the ice, I found the pond’s bottom to be unexpectedly regular and level, with variations of only a foot over long distances. Many believe in dangerous depths, but water levels these out. The bottom’s regularity matched the surrounding landscape so well that prominent features could be traced through soundings.

After charting the pond’s depths, I discovered the deepest point lay at the intersection of its longest and widest measurements, a surprising coincidence. This observation might apply universally, suggesting similar principles for locating the deepest ocean parts or the tallest mountains, where peaks and valleys have their own rules.

Of the five coves, three had been fully sounded and were found to have bars crossing their mouths, with deeper water inside, forming a basin. This suggests that these coves expand vertically as well as horizontally within the land, with the direction of the capes indicating the bar's course. Similarly, every sea-coast harbor has a bar at its entrance. The wider the cove's mouth relative to its length, the deeper the water over the bar compared to the basin. Knowing the cove's dimensions and surrounding shore characteristics allows one to almost create a universal formula.

To test my ability to estimate the deepest point in a pond by observing only its surface outline and shore character, I mapped White Pond, which spans about forty-one acres with no island or visible inlet/outlet. I marked the deepest point near the line of greatest length where two opposite capes nearly met. The actual deepest point was within one hundred feet of my guess and one foot deeper at sixty feet. The presence of a stream or island would complicate this further.

Understanding all natural laws would enable one fact to infer all results at a point. Currently, our limited knowledge and ignorance of vital elements skew results, not Nature's inherent order. Our perceptions of law and harmony depend on detectible instances, though larger, undetected concurring laws create even more remarkable harmony. Individual laws are like viewpoints varying with perspective, similar to how a mountain outline changes with each step, yet retains only one form overall.

The pond's nature parallels ethics, where the 'law of average' applies. This rule of diameters not only guides astronomical bodies but also human character. By knowing a person's tendencies and environment, one might infer their depth and concealed qualities. Surrounding peaks suggest a deep character, while a smooth shore implies shallowness. In people, prominent features hint at deep thoughts. Each of our inclinations, shaped by external influences, forms harbors where thoughts temporarily settle. Over time, these inclinations can become self-contained lakes, changing from salt to fresh water, transforming into different forms of thought.

In Walden Pond, the only visible inlets/outlets are rain, snow, and evaporation. During ice cutting in ’46–7, thinner ice suggested an inlet. They also showed me a possible "leach hole" indicating an outlet. Conducting experiments like using colored powder might verify its connection to a nearby meadow.

While surveying, the ice, sixteen inches thick, fluctuated slightly under wind pressure, revealing how a level can't be used on ice. The greatest observed fluctuation was three-quarters of an inch at one rod from the shore, indicating potential larger movements in the middle. When I cut holes for sounding, water flowed in, forming streams that wore away the ice, nearly drying the pond's surface. This process, like cutting a hole at a ship's bottom to let water out, was visually interesting when refreezing created mottled "ice rosettes." Additionally, shallow puddles on the ice sometimes produced double shadows, one on the ice and another on distant trees or hills.

In the cold January, with thick snow and solid ice, a prudent landlord collects ice to cool his summer drinks, anticipating July's heat. He meticulously cuts the frozen pond, disrupting the fish habitat, and transports the ice to winter cellars, where it looks like solid azure as it moves through the streets. These ice-cutters, a merry and playful group, often invited me to join their work.

In the winter of ’46–7, a hundred men from Hyperborea descended on our pond with various farming tools, though I initially thought they came to plant winter rye. They aimed to double a gentleman farmer's fortune by harvesting the pond’s ice, stripping Walden Pond of its icy covering. They worked methodically, and I watched, expecting seeds to be planted, only to realize they were cutting peat-like ice.

To clarify, these were a hundred Irishmen, supervised by Yankees, who came daily from Cambridge to harvest the ice. Using recognized methods, they divided the ice into cakes, transported them to shore, and stacked them with hay as insulation. Their efforts could yield a thousand tons a day, with horses feeding from ice hollowed like buckets. The ice stacks, initially blue and imposing, were soon covered in hay, resembling a mystical, moss-covered ruin.

Despite their efforts, much of the ice never reached its destination due to air content and improper storage. By July, only a portion had been carried off, and the rest stood until September 1848 before melting. Walden Pond gradually reclaimed its ice.

Nearby, Walden ice appears green up close but turns blue from afar, distinct from other ice. Occasionally, a dropped ice block becomes a temporary village spectacle. Observing these changes, I pondered the nature of water and ice, recognizing its intriguing properties.

For sixteen days, I observed the bustling activity from my window, likening it to scenes from an almanac or ancient parables. Eventually, the workers left, and soon Walden Pond would return to solitude, reflecting nature's tranquility. The serene scene would likely host only a solitary loon or quiet fisher.

Reflecting on this, I realized the ice from Walden Pond reached places like Charleston, New Orleans, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta. Each morning, I immersed myself in the profound philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita, feeling a connection to an ancient wisdom far surpassing modern thought. Visiting my well, I imagined the mingling of Walden water with the sacred Ganges, traversing mythical lands and distant seas, echoing legends known to Alexander.

Spring

Ice-cutting often causes ponds to break up earlier since wind-agitated water erodes the surrounding ice. However, this was not the case for Walden Pond that year. Walden, due to its depth and lack of streams, typically breaks up later than other nearby ponds. It generally opens around the first of April, a week or ten days after Flint’s Pond and Fair-Haven. Walden’s temperature changes more steadily, barely influenced by short cold spells.

On March 6th, 1847, a thermometer showed the same temperature at the center of Walden and Flint’s Pond, but the shallow waters of Flint’s Pond were 3.5 degrees warmer. This difference accelerates Flint’s breakup compared to Walden. In mid-winter, Walden’s center was warmer with thinner ice. In the summer, the water near Walden’s shore is warmer compared to deeper waters.

Spring sun impacts the pond by penetrating and reflecting through the ice, melting it from below as well as above, causing unevenness and forming air bubbles which make the ice honeycombed. Radiation around rocks causes thin ice to dissolve quicker. Warm winter rains remove snow-ice, leaving transparent ice in the middle, and a strip of white ice around the shores, influenced by the sun’s reflection and trapped air bubbles acting as magnifying glasses.

Daily temperature changes in the pond mimic annual cycles, with morning warming shallow waters faster, evening cooling them quicker, and daily cracking noises denoting temperature shifts. On February 24th, 1850, Flint’s Pond resonated when struck, booming loudly as the sun rose, quieting at noon, and resuming as the sun set. This "thundering" influences fishing and is a natural response like buds opening in spring, showing the pond’s sensitivity to atmospheric changes.

One of the attractions of living in the woods was having the leisure to observe the arrival of spring. Gradually, the ice on the pond begins to thaw under fogs, rains, and warmer sunshine, and I find myself no longer needing large fires as the days grow longer. I am eager for the first signs of spring—whether it's a bird's note or a squirrel's chirp. By mid-March, despite hearing birds like the bluebird and song-sparrow, the ice remains thick. However, warmer weather causes the ice to honeycomb and eventually disappear overnight after a warm rain, as I experienced one year.

In observing the local climate, the breaking of ice on rivers and ponds is notable. The sounds are startling, akin to artillery, and rapid thawing follows. An old man, wise in nature's ways, recounted how one spring, expecting ducks, he found a pond mostly ice-covered. As he waited, a grand noise grew, revealing itself to be the ice drifting to shore and breaking into pieces, surprising him with its force.

As spring progresses, melting snow and warming winds transform the landscape, creating rushing streams that bear off winter’s remnants. One of my favorite phenomena is watching thawing sand and clay form intricate patterns on a railroad cut near the village. The sand flows like lava, creating a hybrid of flowing streams and vegetation-like shapes, making elaborate designs reminiscent of coral, leaves, and animal forms. These shapes vividly illustrate nature's creativity, akin to an artist at work.

Observing these sand formations suggests the interconnectedness of organic and inorganic forms. Thawing sand organizes into stream channels, mirroring blood vessels and showcasing nature's inherent laws. This phenomenon on a hillside appears to encapsulate the principles governing all natural operations, hinting that the Earth is alive and continually creating, rather than a mere historical artifact.

This process, where Earth reveals its inner workings, is exhilarating and more inspiring than any cultivated landscape. Nature’s activities suggest vitality and creativity, reminding us that the Earth is a living entity. Even as metals are melted and cast, they don’t compare to the dynamic forms created by molten earth. Nature’s workings, and the changing institutions upon it, remain as malleable as clay in a potter’s hands.

Soon, frost emerges from the ground like a dormant creature and heads to the sea or migrates in clouds. Thaw, gentle and persuasive, is more powerful than Thor's hammer, as it melts rather than breaks.

When snow partially melts and a few warm days dry the ground, it's lovely to see the first signs of the new year peeking forth alongside the withered but still beautiful vegetation of life-everlasting, golden-rods, pinweeds, and wild grasses. These plants, while often overlooked in summer, now seem more beautiful, as if their beauty only ripens after winter. Even cotton-grass, cat-tails, mulleins, johnswort, hard-hack, meadow-sweet, and sturdy plants feed the earliest birds, serving as widowed Nature’s adornments. The wool-grass's arching top recalls summer and is admired in art, similar to how astronomy reflects the mind’s preexisting ideas. Winter's phenomena, often described as harsh, also convey delicacy and tenderness, adorning summer’s tresses with love.

With spring’s arrival, red-squirrels made a home under my house, chattering and chirping loudly, undeterred by my attempts to silence them. Spring’s first sparrow ushers in youthful hope, accompanied by the silvery warblings of blue-birds, song-sparrows, and red-wings, as if winter’s last flakes tinkle musically to the ground. Brooks sing, the marsh-hawk swoops low in search of early life, melting snow is ubiquitous, and ice rapidly dissolves in ponds. Grass flames up on hillsides, symbolizing perpetual youth, growing steadily alongside trickling rills. From year to year, this green ribbon feeds herds and provides winter supplies, reflecting how human life renews itself.

Walden is rapidly melting, with significant ice fields breaking off. A song-sparrow sings along the shore, aiding in the ice’s fracture. The ice’s edges form beautiful, sweeping curves, responding to the shore’s shape but more regular. Despite the wind’s efforts, it only reaches the sparkling water beyond the ice. The pond, full of life and joy, contrasts sharply with winter’s death. The transformation from winter’s gloom to spring’s brightness is sudden and profound. Light filled my house, despite overhanging winter clouds and sleety rain. Outside, the cold gray ice transformed into a transparent pond, reflecting a summer sky despite none being visible. The sweet song of a robin marked spring’s arrival.

At twilight, pitch-pines and shrub-oaks brightened and stood more vibrant, as though cleansed by the rain. The honking of geese flying low heralded spring night’s onset. Startled by their passage, they discovered my light and settled on the pond. I shut the door and enjoyed my first spring night in the woods.

In the morning, through mist, geese sailed on the pond, creating a lively scene. From the shore, they took flight, the leader’s honk guiding them northward. Ducks followed, rising simultaneously. For a week, a lone goose sought its companion, filling the woods with its calls. April brought the return of pigeons and martins, whose numbers seemed surprisingly abundant. Everywhere, tortoises and frogs heralded the season, and birds and plants celebrated the rebalancing of nature.

Each season comes with its own beauty. Spring’s arrival feels like the creation of order from chaos, fulfilling the Golden Age's promise.

"The East-Wind withdrew to Aurora and the Nabathæan kingdom, And the Persian, and the ridges placed under the morning rays."

Man was born. Whether made by the Artificer of things from divine seed or from the earth recently separated from the high Ether, carrying seeds of heavenly origin.

A gentle rain makes the grass greener, much like our prospects improve with better thoughts. We should live in the present and take advantage of every circumstance, like grass thriving on the slightest dew, instead of regretting past missed opportunities. We linger in winter when it is already spring. On a beautiful spring morning, all sins are forgiven, and even the worst sinner may return to goodness. This renewed innocence reveals our neighbors' innocence as well. You may know someone as a thief or drunkard and despise him, but on this first spring morning, the world is re-created. You meet him engaged in serene work, witnessing his transformation. His faults are forgotten, and a sense of holiness emerges, even if feebly. For a brief moment, he shows new, tender potential, just like a fresh plant. He has joined in the joy of the Lord. Why do the jailer, judge, and preacher not act on God's hint to offer pardon? Because they do not accept God's freely given pardon.

"A return to goodness each morning, with its tranquil and beneficent breath, makes one closer to the primitive nature of man, like new sprouts in a felled forest. The evil done during the day prevents these sprouts from developing. 

Repeatedly preventing virtue's growth, eventually, the evening's breath is insufficient to preserve them, reducing man's nature to that of a brute. Viewing such a man, others believe he never had the innate faculty of reason. Are these the true sentiments of man?"

The Golden Age was first, with spontaneous fidelity and rectitude, without law or fear. No punishment, no threats, no terrified crowds before judges. Without felled pines meeting foreign waves, mortals knew only their own shores.

"On April 29th, while fishing near the Nine-Acre-Corner bridge, I stood on the quaking grass and willow roots. Suddenly, I heard a rattling sound like boys playing with sticks. Looking up, I saw a graceful hawk soaring and tumbling, its underwings gleaming in the sun. This ethereal flight reminded me of falconry's nobleness. It flew with a unique, proud elegance, tumbling and recovering effortlessly, seeming solitary yet complete in its environment. Its nest must be somewhere extraordinary, perhaps woven from rainbows and sunset sky.

That day, I also caught a string of golden, silver, and coppery fish, resembling jewels. Often, I explored these meadows on spring mornings, jumping from hummock to hummock, bathed in pure, bright light that seemed powerful enough to revive the dead. Such light speaks to immortality, making death seem powerless.

Our village life thrives on the surrounding unexplored forests and meadows. We need the tonic of wildness—to wade in marshes, hear the snipe, smell the sedge, and observe solitary fowls and mink. While we seek to explore all things, we also crave the mystery of the unexplorable. Nature's inexhaustible vigor, vast features, and chaotic beauty, like shipwrecked coasts and thunderclouds, refresh us. Observing nature’s cycles, even through decay, reinforces our understanding of life’s resilience. Witnessing vultures thrive on carrion, I appreciated nature's inviolable health. A dead horse near my path was unpleasant but reassured me of nature's robust cycle. 

In May, the new leaves of oaks, hickories, and maples brightened the landscape, especially on cloudy days. Early in the month, I saw a loon in the pond and heard the whippoorwill, brown-thrasher, veery, wood-pewee, chewink, and other birds. The wood-thrush had returned, and the phœbe visited my cabin, inspecting its suitability. The pond's surface and nearby objects soon were covered with pitch-pine pollen, appearing like ‘sulphur showers.’ As the seasons transitioned into summer, the grass grew taller.

This marked the end of my first year in the woods, with the second year similar. I left Walden on September 6th, 1847."

Conclusion

Doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery for the ill. Thankfully, our world is vast. The buckeye doesn't grow in New England, and the mockingbird is rarely heard there. The wild goose is more worldly than us, traveling from Canada to Ohio to a southern bayou. The bison also migrates, moving from Colorado's pastures to Yellowstone's greener grass. Yet, we often think our lives are defined by local boundaries. Even if you're the town clerk, you can still explore this wide universe, not just Tierra del Fuego.

We should more often look beyond our immediate surroundings, like curious passengers, not like sailors focused on routine tasks. The other side of the world is simply home to someone else. Doctors only treat surface ailments; true voyages should explore deeper realms. Chasing giraffes in Southern Africa is trivial compared to exploring the vast regions within your own mind.

Reflect inward and discover unexplored territories in your mind. Traveling internally offers more significant discoveries than external voyages. Should we concern ourselves with finding the source of great rivers or lost explorers? Instead, we should explore our own streams and metaphorical oceans, sustaining ourselves with inner resources. Be like Columbus, discovering new continents of thought within you.

Every person is the ruler of an internal realm far larger than any earthly empire. Yet, some prioritize patriotic duty over self-discovery. They cherish the land that will be their grave but neglect the spirit within. Real patriotism should include self-respect and exploration of the moral world, something far harder than external voyages, even over vast distances and through hardships.

Let others wander distant lands; I find more meaning within myself.

Circumventing the globe to count Zanzibar's cats seems pointless. However, continuing until better opportunities arise could reveal unexpected insights. Nations like England, France, Spain, Portugal, Gold Coast, and Slave Coast border this metaphorical sea but haven’t braved its depths, despite it being a direct route to India. To experience all cultures, speak all languages, and surpass all travelers, one must explore oneself, requiring true vision and courage. Only those who flee challenges enlist in wars—they are the real cowards. Begin this ultimate journey, which transcends mere geography to explore deeper truths, day and night, through all seasons.

Mirabeau resorted to highway robbery to test his resolve against society's laws, claiming it took more courage than fighting in the military and that honor and religion didn’t hinder a firm resolve. Though bold, this was futile. A wiser man would encounter enough opposition to sacred societal laws by obeying higher, intrinsic laws, without deliberately opposing society. It's not about confronting society but about faithfully following one’s own nature, which wouldn’t conflict with a just government.

I left the woods with as valid a reason as I had for going there. I felt other lives awaited me and I couldn't spend more time on just one. It's surprising how quickly we fall into routines, creating well-worn paths both physically and mentally. Though I haven't walked that woodland path in years, it remains clear. The earth and our minds are easily shaped by our actions, leading to deeply ingrained traditions and conformities. I didn’t seek a passive role in life but wanted to fully experience the world, witnessing its beauty firsthand, not retreating below deck.

From my experiment, I learned that pursuing one’s dreams with confidence leads to unexpected success. It simplifies life, making the universe’s laws clearer. In such simplicity, solitude isn't lonely, poverty isn’t burdensome, and weakness isn't a hindrance. Aim to realize your dreams, laying solid foundations beneath them.

England and America err by demanding speech be universally understandable, as if simplicity were the only safety. Nature supports diverse forms of understanding. My concern is not limiting my expression, but ensuring it fully captures the truth I've perceived. Like a migrating buffalo seeking new pastures, not a cow disrupting routine, one must speak without bounds, conveying truths that exceed mundane experiences. Words reflecting true faith and piety, though imprecise, are profound and fragrant.

Why limit ourselves to the dullest perception, calling it common sense? Often, those with greater wit are undervalued because only a fraction of their intelligence is appreciated. Some criticize multifaceted writings, yet the richness of different interpretations should be celebrated, not condemned. As some strive to cure potato blight, others should address the more pervasive brain-rot.

I'm not aiming for obscurity, but would welcome criticism that, like the purity of blue Walden ice, is misunderstood. The purity people cherish often resembles earthly mists rather than the clear ether above.

Some claim modern intellect pales in comparison to the ancients’. But what of it? A living dog is better than a dead lion. Let's each strive to fulfill our potential rather than lament our stature. Focus on being the best you can be.

Why rush success or pursue desperate ventures? If someone doesn't keep pace with others, perhaps they follow their own rhythm. Let them move to their own unique beat, regardless of the measure. Each should mature at their own pace. We should not hasten our natural progression or settle for a false reality. Why create an artificial heaven when the true, ethereal one awaits above?

In the city of Kouroo, there was an artist who sought perfection. Deciding to make a perfect staff, he ventured into the forest for the finest wood, rejecting materials one by one. His friends aged and died, but he remained youthful due to his unwavering dedication. As time passed, the city became ruins, dynasties ended, and stars shifted, yet he continued his work. When he finally completed the staff, it transformed into a magnificent creation, revealing that time had been an illusion for him. His purity of material and art resulted in an extraordinary masterpiece.

Living truthfully endures best. Often, we place ourselves in imaginary situations, complicating our reality. In clear moments, we should focus on facts. Say what you need to, not what you think you should. Genuine truth always surpasses pretense. Even on the gallows, Tom Hyde's parting words were practical advice, overshadowing more pious sentiments.

Embrace your life, regardless of its hardships. A humble life can offer precious moments. The sun shines equally on the poorhouse and the mansion. A content mind can find peace anywhere. The town's poor often lead the most independent lives, accepting support without shame. Many reject such help while resorting to dishonesty to sustain themselves. Cultivate simplicity and focus on what matters. Material change is superficial; we change internally. Retain your thoughts over new possessions. Even confined, one's world is vast with rich thoughts. No external force can strip thought from a person. Don't seek unnecessary development or influence—true insight comes from within. Poverty narrows our focus to the essential, revealing life's sweetest parts. Wealth may buy extras, but not what the soul truly needs.

I live reclusively, uninterested in society's noise and concerns about status and fashion. Conversations about notables and distant places bore me. I prefer to ponder deeply, align with the universe's truths, and avoid the chaotic speed of the present era. Society's celebrations and committees seem empty. Progress and satisfaction come from genuine, solid work, not superficial achievements. Like understanding the depth of a swamp only through experience, true value is found in depth and sincerity. Every action should be deliberate and firm, contributing purposefully to the greater scheme.

Rather than love, money, or fame, give me truth. I once dined at a lavish table with abundant food, wine, and obsequious service, but found no sincerity or truth, leaving hungry from the cold hospitality. The wealth and grandeur meant nothing to me. They boasted about the age and quality of their wine, but I longed for a purer, more glorious vintage that they lacked and couldn't buy. I visited a king who left me waiting and displayed no real hospitality, in contrast to a neighbor living in a hollow tree whose manners were truly regal. I should have visited him instead.

How long will we practice outdated virtues, idly congratulating ourselves on past achievements? Our generation prides itself on its illustrious lineage and achievements in art, science, and literature. We have records of philosophical societies and public eulogies of great men, celebrating our deeds as if they will never fade. Yet, where are the learned societies and great men of Assyria now? We're early in humanity's journey, merely scratching the surface of the earth and understanding little about where we stand. We spend half our time asleep, yet consider ourselves wise and orderly. We are ambitious thinkers, much like an insect hiding in the forest, unaware of the greater intelligence watching over it.

Despite the constant influx of novelty, we tolerate incredible dullness. The sermons listened to in enlightened countries often lack true joy or sorrow, and we believe in the ordinary and mean. We think we can only change our clothes, ignoring the deeper tides of change within us. The British Empire and the United States may seem powerful, but they are insignificant compared to the individual mind's potential. The governance of the world wasn't discussed over wine like Britain's.

Life within us is like river water, capable of rising higher than ever known and transforming the landscape. The banks of ancient streams, now far inland, remind us of changes before scientific records began. Consider the tale of the bug emerging from an old apple-tree table, symbolizing resurrection and immortality. It had been buried for years, only to come forth unexpectedly, suggesting that a beautiful, winged life might one day emerge from society's dry, trivial existence.

I don't claim that John or Jonathan will realize this, but such is the nature of a future that mere time cannot bring. The light that blinds us is darkness. Only the day we are awake to will dawn. There is more daylight ahead; the sun is but a morning star.

THE END

ON THE DUTY OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE

I agree with the motto, “That government is best which governs least,” and wish to see it implemented more swiftly and methodically. Ultimately, this translates to, “That government is best which governs not at all,” and when people are ready, they will adopt such a system. Government is, at best, a necessary evil; most are often, and all are occasionally, a hindrance. The numerous and valid objections against a standing army also apply to a standing government. Both can be misused by a few individuals before the public can act. The current Mexican war, driven by a few using the government as a tool, is a prime example; initially, the public would not have agreed to it.

The American government is essentially a tradition, aiming to perpetuate itself but losing integrity over time. It lacks the vitality of a single individual since it can be manipulated by one person. It is like a wooden gun to the people; if used earnestly, it would break. Nevertheless, some form of government machinery is necessary to satisfy people's idea of governance. Governments demonstrate how easily individuals can deceive themselves for their benefit. While government is beneficial, it never advanced any enterprise except by stepping out of the way. The inherent character of the American people has achieved all progress, which might have been greater without governmental interference. Government is meant to enable people to leave each other alone; at its best, it does precisely that. Trade and commerce, resilient like rubber, manage to overcome obstacles continually placed by legislators. If judged solely on their actions, these lawmakers would be likened to those who sabotage railroads and punished accordingly.

Practically speaking, as a citizen, I do not advocate for no government, but for a better one. Each individual should express the kind of government that deserves respect, moving closer to achieving it.

The reason a majority rules once power is in the people's hands is not that they are right, but because they are the strongest. However, a government where the majority rules on all matters cannot be just. Can we not have a government where conscience, not majority rule, determines right and wrong, with majorities deciding only on expediency? Should a citizen ever surrender his conscience to a legislator, even slightly? Every person has a conscience; we should be men first, subjects second. Respect for the right should trump respect for the law. Obligations arise from doing what one believes is right. While corporations have no conscience, a group of conscientious individuals forms a collective with a conscience. Law does not make men just, and undue respect for it turns even the well-meaning into agents of injustice. Excessive respect for the law results in soldiers marching to wars against their will, common sense, and conscience, causing great personal conflict. These soldiers, inclined towards peace, become tools of unscrupulous leaders, resembling movable forts and munition stores. Visit the Navy Yard to see what the American government can turn a man into: a shadow of humanity, effectively buried under arms and ceremonial rituals, uncelebrated even in death.

Most men serve the State not as thinking individuals but as mere machines, through roles like soldiers, jailers, and constables, without exercising their judgment or morals. They are valued no more than animals and are often considered good citizens. Others, like legislators and lawyers, serve with their intellect but lack moral distinctions, potentially aiding evil as much as good. A few, like heroes and reformers, serve the State with their conscience, often resisting it and being treated as enemies. A wise man serves usefully as himself, not as mere clay to fill a gap.

“I am too high-born to be propertied,
To be a secondary at control,
Or useful serving-man and instrument
To any sovereign state throughout the world.”

One who devotes himself entirely to his fellow-men may seem selfish to them, while partial dedication earns praise as a benefactor.

Regarding the American government, a man cannot associate with it without disgrace, as it also governs slaves. Everyone recognizes the right of revolution against unbearable tyranny or inefficiency, though many believe the present situation does not justify it. They think it was justified in the Revolution of '75. A government taxing imports might not warrant rebellion, as all systems have friction, and minor evils can be tolerated if balanced by good. However, when oppression becomes systemic, such a machine must be abolished. When a nation's population is enslaved and another country is unjustly invaded, it is time for honest men to rebel. The urgency is heightened when the oppressing army is our own.

Paley argues that civil obedience is based on expediency, suggesting that a government should be obeyed as long as it benefits society more than it inconveniences. He reduces resistance to a calculation of danger versus the cost of redress, leaving each man to judge for himself. However, Paley ignores scenarios where justice must be pursued regardless of cost. If I stole a plank from a drowning man, I must return it even at my own peril. To Paley, this would be inconvenient, but true justice requires it. This nation must end slavery and stop warring with Mexico, even if it means risking its own survival.

Nations often follow Paley's thinking, but is Massachusetts acting righteously now?

“A drab of state, a cloth-o’-silver slut,
To have her train borne up, and her soul trail in the dirt.”

The real opponents of reform in Massachusetts are not Southern politicians, but local merchants and farmers more interested in commerce and agriculture than in justice for slaves and Mexico. My issue is with those nearby who support and follow the orders of distant oppressors, without whom these oppressors would be powerless. The belief that the masses are unprepared is misleading; progress is slow because few are significantly wiser or better. It’s more crucial to have some absolute goodness than for many to be somewhat good, as this can inspire overall improvement. Many oppose slavery and war in theory but do nothing to end them, instead preferring to focus on commerce and free-trade. They hesitate, regret, and petition but do not take effective action, leaving the burden for others to resolve.

Voting is like gaming, involving moral questions and bets, without real stakes for the voters. Voting for the right is merely a weak expression of preference, leaving the decision to the majority. True change should not be left to chance or majority power. Mass action lacks virtue; majority support for abolition will come only when slavery is almost gone. Only those who assert their freedom through their vote can hasten abolition.

A convention to select a Presidential candidate, mainly attended by editors and professional politicians, seems irrelevant to truly independent, intelligent people, who could rely on their judgment and vote independently. Yet, respectable individuals often abandon their positions and embrace these candidates, showing they are easily swayed by demagogues. Their votes become worthless, akin to those bought by unprincipled individuals. We need genuine, self-reliant men, not those who mindlessly follow popular opinion.

A man need not focus solely on eradicating every wrong, but he must at least withdraw his support from it. Pursuing other interests is fine only if it does not come at the expense of others’ freedom. It’s inconsistent to refuse personally aiding in unjust actions while still supporting the unjust government through allegiance and taxes. Celebrating soldiers who refuse to serve in unjust wars while supporting the government that wages them is hypocritical. Under the guise of Order and Civil Government, society ends up supporting its own shortcomings. Immoral actions become normalized and seemingly necessary in the lives we've created.

The broadest and most persistent errors demand the most unbiased virtue to endure them. Patriotic virtue, though often slighted, is most likely to be exhibited by those who, while criticizing their government’s actions, still offer their allegiance and support. These individuals, being the most conscientious supporters, are ironically the greatest obstacles to reform. Some petition the State to dissolve the Union or defy the President’s orders. Why don't they sever their own ties with the State and stop contributing to its treasury? They are as bound to the State as the State is to the Union, prevented by the same reasons from resisting.

How can one be content with merely holding an opinion, especially if it involves being wronged? If your neighbor cheats you out of a dollar, you don’t just acknowledge or complain; you take action to recover your money and ensure it doesn't happen again. Action based on principle—perceiving and doing what's right—changes things fundamentally. It is revolutionary, dividing states, churches, families, and even the individual, separating their moral extremes.

In the presence of unjust laws, should we obey, seek to amend them while still obeying, or transgress them immediately? Under such governments, people often think they should wait to persuade the majority for change, fearing the remedy might be worse than the evil. This fault lies with the government, which fails to facilitate reform and support its wise minority. It resists criticism and silences progressive voices, treating them as rebels rather than valuing their input.

The government seems unprepared for outright denial of its authority, evidenced by its disproportionate penalties. A poor man refusing to earn for the State can be imprisoned indefinitely at the discretion of those in power, while a thief stealing repeatedly from the State may quickly be released.

If injustice is just part of the government's functioning, we might let it go, hoping it will either smooth out or the system will wear out. If injustice is specifically engineered, one might consider if resisting it is worth the trouble. But, if it compels us to participate in wrongdoing, we must break the law and let our lives be the counter-force. We should ensure we don't contribute to the wrongs we condemn.

Relying on the State's slow remedies isn’t feasible; life is short and there are other responsibilities. We are here to live life, not to perfect the world. One need not do everything, but we must avoid doing wrong. Petitioning the Governor or Legislature is as futile as expecting them to petition us, especially when the Constitution itself is the problem. This might seem harsh, but it's actually the kindest approach to true reform.

Abolitionists should withdraw their support from the Massachusetts government immediately rather than waiting to become the majority. With God on their side, they already represent a powerful majority. Any person more righteous than his neighbors already constitutes a majority of one.

I encounter the American government, or its state representative, once a year through the tax collector. This is the only direct interaction I have with it, where it demands acknowledgment. The most straightforward way to express my dissatisfaction with the government is by refusing to pay taxes. My neighbor, the tax collector, voluntarily serves the government, and he needs to consider whether he treats me as a respected neighbor or a disruptor of peace. If a few honest men in Massachusetts stopped paying taxes and were jailed, it could lead to the abolition of slavery in America. Even a small act, once done correctly, is eternal.

Talking about reform is easy; acting on it is rare. Few commit to such causes, although newspapers are filled with reform rhetoric. If a respectable neighbor, working on human rights issues, chose to go to prison rather than support slavery, it would force a big discussion in the legislature. A just man’s rightful place in an unjust government is in prison. The prisons of Massachusetts should house those who oppose the state, embodying honorable resistance. The state doesn’t offer much to those who challenge its morals; thus, minor taxes can feel burdensome to them.

Truth holds more power than error, and a man who has suffered injustice can combat it most effectively. Casting your whole influence, not just a paper vote, is crucial. A minority is powerless if it conforms to the majority but becomes a force when it stands firm. If just men in significant numbers refused to pay taxes, it would create a peaceful revolution. When the tax-gatherer or any public officer asks for guidance, my response is to resign if they truly wish to make a difference. When citizens refuse allegiance and officers resign, the revolution is complete. Sacrificing one’s conscience wounds one’s manhood and leads to an everlasting death.

The imprisonment of resisters, rather than property seizure, is preferred because they, usually with limited property, find such taxes exorbitant. Wealth often corrupts, distancing a man from his moral ground. The rich must strive to maintain values they had when poor. When Christ addressed the Herodians about tribute money, he implied that compliance with state demands is necessary if one benefits from it. However, true wisdom lies in knowing what belongs to the state and what belongs to God.

Many fear disobeying the government due to the protection it offers their property and families. Personally, I avoid relying on state protection. If I challenge its authority by refusing taxes, the state will seize and waste my property, causing endless harassment for me and my children. This situation forces one to live modestly, relying solely on oneself. One could prosper in any country, like Turkey, by being a compliant subject. Confucius stated that under a rational government, poverty is shameful; under an irrational one, wealth is shameful. Until I need Massachusetts’ protection for liberties elsewhere or aim to build an estate peacefully at home, I can afford to reject its claims on my property and life. Disobedience costs me less than obedience, both materially and morally.

Years ago, the State demanded I pay a sum to support a clergyman whose preaching my father attended, but I did not. It said, "Pay it, or be jailed." I refused, but another man paid it. I didn't see why a schoolmaster should be taxed for a priest, but not the other way around, especially since I supported myself voluntarily. I didn't understand why the lyceum couldn't also present a tax-bill backed by the State. At the selectmen's request, I wrote, “Know all men by these presents, that I, Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which I have not joined.” I gave this to the town-clerk. Since then, the State hasn't taxed me similarly, though it initially adhered to its presumption. Had I known how, I would've resigned from all the societies I never joined, but I didn't know where to find such a list.

For six years, I paid no poll tax and was jailed for one night because of it. As I looked at the thick walls and iron door, I saw the foolishness of treating me as mere flesh to be locked up. It hadn't thought to use my services in some meaningful way. There was a greater barrier between my townsmen and true freedom than the stone wall between us. I never felt confined; the walls were a waste of stone and mortar. My townsmen, not knowing how to treat me, acted awkwardly. They believed my main desire was to be outside the wall. It amused me to see them lock the door on my thoughts, which remained free. Unable to reach me, they punished my body, as spiteful boys might mistreat a dog. I realized the State was half-witted, timid, unable to distinguish friends from foes, and I lost respect for it.

The State confronts only a man's body, not his intellect or morals, using physical force rather than wit or honesty. I wasn't born to be forced; I'd breathe as I wished. Strength should come from obeying a higher law. I won't be hurried to give my money to a government demanding "Your money or your life." It needs to help itself, as I do. I'm not responsible for society's machinery; I'm not its engineer. Just as acorns and chestnuts obey their own laws and grow as they can, so should a man live according to his nature, or perish trying.

The night in prison was novel and quite interesting. When I arrived, prisoners were chatting at the door, enjoying the evening air, until the jailer told them it was time to lock up. My cellmate, introduced by the jailer as "a first-rate fellow," showed me where to hang my hat and manage in the cell. The rooms were whitewashed monthly, and ours was the cleanest and simplest in town. Curious, he asked why I was there, and when I reciprocated, he explained he was accused of burning a barn, which he denied. Likely, he had fallen asleep drunk in a barn with his pipe, resulting in the fire. He had been waiting three months for his trial and was content with the free board.

He took one window, and I took the other, realizing that looking out would become our main activity if we stayed long. I read all the tracts, examined where prisoners tried to escape, and heard the stories of former occupants. Surprisingly, jail had its own exclusive gossip and history. I saw verses composed by young men caught during an escape attempt, shared in a circular form but not published.

Extracting all I could from my cellmate, fearing we'd never meet again, he eventually showed me my bed and left me to extinguish the lamp. It felt like traveling to an unknown land. The town-clock striking and village sounds seemed new as we slept with windows open. My native village transformed in my perception, evoking visions of knights and castles, and I felt immersed in its essence. It was a rare, closer view of the town’s institutions, making me understand its people better.

Breakfast came through a hole in the door in tin pans with chocolate, brown bread, and an iron spoon. Naively, I tried to return leftover bread, but my cellmate advised keeping it for later. He then left for his daily haying work in a nearby field, likely our last interaction.

Upon release, courtesy of someone paying my tax, I noticed no significant visible changes. However, my perspective on the town, state, and country fundamentally shifted. I realized the superficial nature of my neighbors' friendship, their prejudices, and reluctance to take risks for humanity. They were distinct from me, akin to a different race. Their sacrifices were minimal, aiming to save their souls through outward observance and occasional prayers. I judged them harshly, believing many were unaware of the jail’s presence.

Traditionally, villagers greeted released debtors with crossed fingers representing jail bars. My neighbors simply stared, as though I’d returned from a long journey. I was jailed en route to getting a mended shoe and resumed my errand upon release. After putting on my shoe, I joined an impatient huckleberry party, and soon, we were two miles away in a huckleberry field, where the State faded from view.

This is the full account of "My Prisons."

I have always paid the highway tax, valuing being a good neighbor as much as being a bad subject. As for school support, I contribute by educating my fellow citizens. My refusal to pay taxes isn't about any specific item; I simply want to withdraw my allegiance from the State. I don't track my tax dollar to see if it funds injustice, but I do worry about the impact of my allegiance. In my own quiet way, I declare war on the State, though I still use its benefits as is common.

If others pay my tax out of sympathy for the State or to protect me from jail or property loss, they are enabling greater injustice than required. Such actions stem from unwise interference of private feelings with public good.

This is my current stance, but one must guard against actions influenced by stubbornness or undue concern for others' opinions. One should act according to personal conscience.

Sometimes, I consider that people are well-meaning but ignorant and would do better if they knew how. Yet this does not justify conforming to their actions or allowing greater suffering. When millions demand a small tax without personal malice or the possibility of negotiating, why oppose such overwhelming force? We don't resist natural forces like cold and hunger with such obstinacy. However, since this force involves human relations, appeal is possible, first to their conscience, and then to themselves. If I fail to protest injustice, I cannot blame anyone but myself.

If I believed in accepting people as they are without expecting more from them or myself, like a fatalist, I would be satisfied and say it is God's will. Unlike natural forces, this human force can be resisted effectively.

I seek no quarrel with anyone and do not set myself above my neighbors. Actually, I look for reasons to conform to the laws. Each year when the tax collector arrives, I review the acts of the government and the people's spirit, seeking a reason to conform.

“We must affect our country as our parents,

And if at any time we alienate

Our love of industry from doing it honor,

We must respect effects and teach the soul

Matter of conscience and religion,

And not desire of rule or benefit.”

I believe the State will soon handle all my related work, making me no better patriot than my peers. From a basic view, the Constitution, despite its flaws, is good; the law and courts are respectable; and this State and American government are admirable in many respects. From a higher perspective, however, their true value is debatable.

The government concerns me little, and I will think about it as minimally as possible. My life isn't dominated by it. A truly free thinker is unaffected by poor rulers or reformers.

Most people think differently from me, and even experts in these subjects provide little satisfaction. Statesmen and legislators, deeply entrenched in the system, fail to see it clearly. They lack an external perspective to genuinely move society. While they've created useful systems, their wisdom is limited. They often forget the world isn't governed by mere policy and expediency. Webster, for instance, never goes beyond government and thus cannot speak authoritatively about it. His words serve those who seek no radical reform but offer little for long-term thinkers and legislators. Compared to other reformers and politicians, Webster's words are sensible and valued, but they lean more towards prudence than wisdom. Lawyer-like, his truth is about consistency rather than pure Truth, which is inherently just and harmonious. Webster, known as the Defender of the Constitution, offers defensive rather than progressive insights. He respects the original arrangement of the Union and supports the Constitution’s stance on slavery.

People who know no purer truth adhere to the Bible and the Constitution, revering them. However, those who seek deeper truths continue their quest.

America has yet to see a true genius in legislation. There are countless orators and politicians, but none capable of resolving today’s issues. We prize eloquence itself, without regard for the truths it may express or the heroism it may incite. Legislators haven't grasped the comparative value of free-trade, freedom, union, and rectitude. They lack the talent for practical issues like taxation, finance, commerce, and agriculture. Without the people's experience and complaints correcting them, America wouldn't maintain its rank globally. Despite the New Testament’s guidance, no legislator has effectively applied its light to legislation.

Even authority I submit to is impure without the consent of the governed. True respect for the individual has grown from monarchy to democracy. Even ancient Chinese philosophy recognized the individual as the empire's base. Is our current democracy the ultimate form of government? Can we further recognize and organize individual rights? A truly free and enlightened State will recognize the individual as a higher power, treating him as a respected neighbor. Such a State, just to all men, would pave the way for an even more perfect and glorious one, which I can imagine but have yet to see.
